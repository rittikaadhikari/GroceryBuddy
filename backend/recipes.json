Slice the tofu into bite-sized cubes.\n\n2 Saut\u00e9 the onions in the pressure cooker: Select the \u201cSaut\u00e9\u201d setting on your electric pressure cooker and adjust it to its highest setting. Heat 4 tablespoons of the oil in the pressure cooker until it shimmers and glides easily, then add the diced onion. Saut\u00e9 the onions until they begin to brown, about 10 minutes.\n\n3 While the onions are browning, sear the tofu in a nonstick skillet: Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering and hot, add the tofu, being careful of the hot, spattering oil. Let the tofu sear for three minutes on one side, then shake the pan or use a spatula to flip the pieces over.\nSear the tofu for another three minutes or so, flipping occasionally. The cubes should have golden brown spots, but it\u2019s fine if some pieces don\u2019t get browned on all sides. Turn off the heat and set the skillet aside.\n\n4 Combine ingredients in the pressure cooker: Once the onions have browned, add the ginger and garlic and saut\u00e9 for another two minutes, until fragrant.\nUse a spoon or spatula to gently stir in the seared tofu, tomatoes, water, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt, taking care not to break up the tofu. Add in the frozen spinach and stir once more. (Reserve the garam masala and coconut milk.)\n\n5 Cook the saag tofu: Place the lid on the pressure cooker and move the sealing valve to its \u201cSealing\u201d position. Cancel the \u201cSaut\u00e9\u201d program, then select the \u201cManual\u201d setting and set the cooking time to 5 minutes at high pressure. (The pot will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure, and then the cooking program will start.)\nWhen the cooking program ends, you can either perform a quick release by moving the sealing valve to its \u201cVenting\u201d position, or let the pressure release naturally. (If you're using an Instant Pot or other pressure cooker with a \"warm\" setting, it's fine for this recipe to stay on the warm setting for a few hours.)\n\n6 Open the pot, stir in the spice blend and coconut milk, and serve: After the pressure has fully released, open the pot. Stir in the garam masala and coconut milk, then taste for seasoning, adding more salt if needed.

Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.\nLine a large casserole with a double layer of heavy-duty foil, or a triple layer of regular foil \u2013 you want a good seal. (Traditionally, cochinita pibil is wrapped in banana leaves, which add a wonderful flavor to the pibil.

Just heat the leaves first to make them more pliable.)\n\nPour in the pork and the marinade and close the foil tightly. Put the casserole in the oven and bake at 325\u00b0F for at least 3 hours.\nYou want it pretty much falling apart, so start checking at the three-hour mark.\n3 Shred cooked pork meat with 2 forks: When the pork is tender, take it out of the oven and open the foil. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon to a bowl, then shred it with two forks. You don\u2019t have to shred the pork, but I like it this way. Pour enough sauce over the meat to make it wet.\n\nTo serve, either use this as taco meat or eat it the way we do: Over rice, garnished with cilantro, lime wedges and queso seco, a Mexican dry cheese a little like Greek feta.

Rub salt over the inside of the cavity.\n3 Stuff herbs under skin: Grasp the skin at the tip of the chicken breast and gently pull up. Use your fingers to gently separate the skin from the breast meat, taking care not to tear the skin. Sprinkle a little salt into the gaps and insert as much of the chopped herb mixture as you can.\n\n4 Stuff the cavity with the lemon, bay leaves, rosemary, and any remaining herbs. Pull the skin of the chicken breast over the breast so that none of the meat is exposed.\n5 Tuck in the wings and truss with kitchen string.\n\n6 Brown the breast side of the chicken in roasting pan in oven: Rub olive oil over the chicken and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Carefully remove the hot roasting pan from the oven and add a little oil to the bottom of the pan. Place the chicken on one side, breast side down, on the roasting pan and put it back in the oven.\nCook for 5 minutes, then turn the chicken so that the other breast is on the pan and cook for another 5 minutes. Starting off by cooking the chicken this way will help brown the breasts.\n7 Turn chicken over and roast until done: Then turn the chicken over so that it is breast-side up.

This will allow them to fit better in the pan, and make them easier to slice later.\n\n2 Dry and season the steak: Thoroughly pat steaks dry with paper towels on each side. The surface should be very dry to help brown the surface of the meat. Generously season each side of the steaks with salt and pepper.\n\n3 Heat the pan: Heat a large 12-inch cast iron skillet over high heat for 3 minutes. Once hot, add the olive oil.\n4 Cook the steak: Use tongs to carefully add the steak to the pan, then press down firmly on the surface a few times for more contact. Sear the first side until browned, about 2 to 4 minutes, depending on the thickness of the meat. Flip and cook another 2 to 4 minutes. For medium rare doneness, cook steak until it reaches an internal temperature of 130\u00baF. Work in two batches if needed.\n\n5 Rest the steak: Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover with foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.\n6 Slice and serve the steak: Hold the carving knife at a 45-degree angle, and then slice the steak across the grain, about 1/4-inch thick slices. Transfer skirt steak to a serving plate.\n"}, {"title": "Mom\u2019s Roast Turkey", "total_time": 255, "ingredients": ["1 turkey, approx. 15 lbs.*", "Juice of a lemon", "Salt and pepper", "Extra virgin olive oil or softened or melted butter", "1/2 yellow onion, peeled and quartered", "Celery tops", "1 to 2 carrots", "1 bunch of parsley", "Several sprigs of fresh rosemary, sage, and/or thyme"], "instructions": "1 Defrost and De-Chill\nIf you are starting with a frozen turkey, you will need to allow several days to defrost the turkey. You'll want to defrost it in the refrigerator so that the turkey stays chilled during this process.\nPut the wrapped frozen turkey in a pan to prevent leaks and then place it in the refrigerator. It will take about 5 hours of defrosting time for every pound of turkey. So if you have a 15 pound turkey, it should take about 75 hours, or 3 days, to defrost.\nIf you need to defrost it more quickly than that, you can place it in a large tub of cool water, and keep changing the water to keep it cold, until the turkey is defrosted.\nRemove the turkey from the refrigerator 2 to 5 hours (depending on the size of the bird) before cooking to allow it to come closer to room temperature. The turkey will cook more quickly and more evenly that way.\n\n2 Remove Giblets and Rinse Turkey\nWhen you are ready to cook the turkey, remove it from its package. Usually turkeys come packaged with the neck and giblets (heart, gizzard, liver) in the main cavity or the neck opening (make sure to check both!)\nPull the giblets out; they are often wrapped in a small paper package.\n\nIf you want, you can chop up the heart and gizzard to make stock for the stuffing or dressing (put the chopped heart and gizzard into a small saucepan, cover with water, add salt, bring to simmer for an hour or so.)\nYou can either cook the neck alongside the turkey, or use it to make turkey stock. You can also use all of the giblets for making giblet gravy.\nRinse the turkey inside and out with water. If you see stray turkey feathers, pluck them out. Use paper towels to pat the turkey dry.\nMany turkeys come with a plastic tie holding the drumsticks together. Check the instructions on the turkey package; it is likely that you will not need to remove the tie unless you are cooking the turkey at a very high temperature.\n\n3 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\n\n4 Insert Aromatics and Truss Turkey\nSlather the inside of the cavity with a tablespoon or so of lemon juice. Take a couple teaspoons of salt and rub all over the inside of the turkey. (Skip salt if you are using a brined turkey.)\n\nPut half an onion cut into wedges, several sprigs of parsley, a chopped carrot or two, and some leafy celery tops into the main cavity of the turkey. These are aromatics that will flavor the turkey from the inside as it cooks.\nCover the entrance to the main cavity with aluminum foil, or close it with metal skewers or kitchen string (not nylon string!), so that the aromatics don't fall out while you are roasting the turkey.\nPut a few sprigs of parsley into the neck opening, cover the opening with the surrounding turkey skin, and close the opening with skewers or string.\nBy the way, we don't cook stuffing (or dressing as it is known in many parts of the country) in the turkey anymore. Stuffing the turkey adds to the overall cooking time, and not packing the turkey with stuffing will allow the turkey to cook more evenly. We do make our stuffing with stock made from the turkey giblets so the stuffing has plenty of turkey flavor.\n\nTo truss or not to truss?\nWe truss our turkey, though some people choose not too. The point of trussing is to keep the legs and wings close to the body so they don't spread out while cooking.\nTo truss, make sure that the turkey's legs are tied together, held close to the body, and tie a string around the turkey body to hold the wings in close. (Here's a good video on trussing: how to truss a turkey.)\n\n5 Rub with Olive Oil or Butter, Salt and Pepper\nRub either softened butter or extra virgin olive oil all over the outside of the turkey. Sprinkle salt generously on all sides of the outside of the turkey (do not add salt if you are using a brined turkey). Sprinkle pepper over the turkey as well.\n\n6 Place Turkey Breast Down on Rack\nPlace the turkey BREAST DOWN on a rack over a sturdy roasting pan big enough to catch all the drippings. How do you know the turkey is breast side down? The wings are up and the legs are down.\n\nNote that you can also place the turkey directly on an oven rack with a large roasting pan to catch the drippings on the rack below. That method helps create a convection-like environment, helping the heat circulate more evenly around the turkey.\nAdd several sprigs of fresh (if possible) thyme, sage, and/or rosemary to the outside of the turkey or tucked under the wings.\nNote that if you are using a remote thermometer (or two) to gauge the temperature of the turkey while it cooks, it's easiest to find the right place to insert the probe when the turkey is breast-side UP. So eyeball where you think the thermometer probe(s) should go first, before placing the turkey breast-side down in the pan. Once the turkey is breast-side down in the pan, insert the probes into the thickest and coldest parts of the breast and/or thighs, making sure the probe(s) is not touching the metal rack or pan. If you only have one remote thermometer, put it in the breast.\n\n7 Roast the Turkey\nBefore you put the turkey in the oven, do a rough calculation of how much overall time it should take to cook the turkey. Usually they say to assume 15 minutes for every pound of meat, but I have found in practice that it's usually less than that, more like 13 minutes per pound.\nCooking time will vary depending on the size of the turkey, how long it has been sitting at room temperature before cooking, and the shape and particulars of your specific oven. So come up with a rough estimate for the overall cooking time, and then make sure to check how the turkey is doing well before it is supposed to be done!\nPut the turkey in the oven at 400\u00b0F, uncovered. For the 15 lb turkey, start the cooking at 400\u00b0F for the first 20 minutes to brown it. Then reduce the heat to 325\u00b0F for the next 1 to 2 hours, until the internal temperature of breast reaches about 140\u00b0F to 145\u00b0F or so. Then reduce the heat further to 225\u00b0F until done, anywhere from a half hour to an hour or more.\nNote that the lower oven temperature at the end of cooking can help you time when you want the turkey to be done. If the turkey is cooking more quickly than you expect, lowering the oven temp can extend the cooking time. If the turkey isn't cooking quickly enough and you're ready to eat, don't lower the temperature to 225\u00b0F, or if you already have, increase it again to 325\u00b0F.\n\nBrowning the Breast\nIf you want the turkey skin of the breast to be browned, when the turkey is close to being done (about 150\u00b0F for the breast), you'll need to turn the turkey over so that the breast is on top, and put it in a 500\u00b0F oven or under the broiler for 4 to 5 minutes, just enough time to brown the breast.\n\nNote that by browning the breast you may end up over-cooking the turkey breast a little bit. We often don't turn the turkey over. Turning the turkey over can be a hot, messy job, so if you do it, the best way is to use clean oven mitts or clean kitchen towels (just throw them in the laundry afterwards.)\n\nTarget Temperatures for Doneness\nStart taking temperature readings with a meat thermometer, inserted deep into the thickest part of the turkey breast and thigh, an hour and a half before the turkey should be done.\nYou want a resulting temperature of 165\u00b0F for the white meat (breast) and 165\u00b0F to 170\u00b0F for the dark meat (thighs and legs). The temperature of the bird will continue to rise once you take it out of the oven, so take the turkey out of the oven when the temperature reading for the breast is 155\u00b0F to 160\u00b0F, and for the thigh is 160\u00b0F to 165\u00b0F. If you don't have a meat thermometer, spear the breast with a knife. The turkey juices should be clear, not pink.\nThe USDA lowered its recommended cooking temperatures for poultry to 165\u00b0F. I've often found that at that temperature the thigh meat near the bone still isn't cooked, so I aim for 170\u00b0F for the thighs.\nIf the thighs reach their target temperature before the breast, turn the turkey over and let the turkey finish cooking breast side up.\n\n8 Let Turkey Rest, Then Carve\nOnce you remove the turkey from the oven, transfer it to a cutting board, tent it with aluminum foil to keep it warm, and let it rest for 15-30 minutes, depending on the size of the turkey. Turn the turkey breast side up to carve it. (See Serious Eats video on How to Carve a Turkey.)\n\nMake the gravy while the turkey is resting covered on the carving board. If you have used a thick metal roasting pan, you can often put it directly on the stovetop burner, if not, scrape off the drippings and put them into a skillet. If you are using the roasting pan, use a metal spatula to scrape loose any dripping that might be stuck to the bottom of the pan.\nUse a metal spoon to ladle off some of the excess fat from the pan (leave about 4 Tbsp or so of fat and drippings in the pan) and reserve for another use.\nYou can use either flour or cornstarch to make the gravy. (We find we get better results with flour, so usually make gravy with flour unless serving a guest who must eat gluten-free.)\nIf using flour, heat the fat and drippings in the pan until they are bubbly. Sprinkle with 1/4 of flour all over the fat and drippings.\nStir with a wire whisk to make a roux with the flour and fat. Let the flour brown a minute or so in the hot pan.\nSlowly add 3 cups of water, stock, or milk to the pan, whisking vigorously to get rid of any lumps. Let the gravy simmer and thicken.\nAdd salt and pepper, ground sage, thyme or other seasonings to taste.\nSee our gravy recipe for more detail and for instructions on making gravy using cornstarch.\nWhen you are finished with your turkey, save the bones from the carcass to make a delicious turkey soup."}, {"title": "Cauliflower Gnocchi with Creamy Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce", "total_time": 60, "ingredients": ["1 batch cauliflower gnocchi (or regular gnocchi), homemade or store-bought", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1/4 cup finely chopped shallots", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "2/3 cup julienned sun-dried tomatoes, oil drained", "1/2 cup unsalted vegetable stock", "1 cup half-and-half", "1/2 teaspoon sea salt", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano, plus more for garnish (or 1/2 teaspoon dried)", "1 tablespoon roughly chopped basil, plus more for garnish ( or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried)", "Black pepper for garnish", "1/4 cup shaved Pecorino Romano cheese"], "instructions": "1 Bring a medium pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

Adjust the sauce as needed. Add a pinch of paprika or cayenne powder for color.\nYou\u2019ll only need about 1/2 cup of sauce for this recipe (1/4 cup per batch). Any extra sauce can be stored in the fridge for up to three months\u2014and/or used on leftovers to spruce them up during reheating.\n\n3 Bring a large pot of water to boil.\n4 Divide all of your ingredients into two batches: Arrange them near your stove. You\u2019ll prepare each batch completely, one after the next.\nWORKING ONE BATCH AT A TIME:\n5 Cook the eggs: Heat a wok or other large pan with high sides over high heat, which you will maintain throughout cooking the pad Thai. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil. When the oil starts to shimmer a bit, it\u2019s ready.\nCrack the eggs for this batch into the pan, and using the tip of a wooden spoon, gently loosen the yolk. You want to have enough oil in the pan so it looks as though the egg is floating, or suspended, in the oil. This gives you more surface area to cook the egg without it burning.\nGently shake and flip the egg around in the pan. Break it up a bit with the spoon, but don\u2019t scramble it by any means. This should take about a minute. Push the eggs off to the side of the pan to make room for the chicken.\n\n6 Cook the chicken: If the pan seems too dry because the eggs have absorbed all of the oil (not likely, but possible), add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of oil to the pan. Add the chicken for this batch. Cook the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes, turning to make sure it cooks most of the way through.\n\n7 Soften the noodles: Take several handfuls of your noodles (about half the total amount) out of the water they\u2019re soaking in, and transfer to a fine mesh sieve. Hold the sieve over the pot of hot water and gently dip the noodles up and down, in and out of the water, to soften them but not cook them per se. (Using the sieve saves you from having to cook and then strain the noodles\u2014and makes the process move more quickly.)\nShake out the excess hot water and taste to make sure the noodles have softened but still have a little give.\n\n8 Add the noodles to the pan: Transfer the noodles to the hot pan; they don\u2019t need to be completely cooked at this point, because they will continue to cook in the wok.\nToss them gently in the pan and stir them briefly to keep them from sticking together. When the noodles look shiny, it\u2019s time for the sauce.\n\n9 Add the sauce: Add about 1/4 cup of the sauce to the pan, and gently toss and flip the noodles in the pan. Stir them quickly to integrate the sauce; you\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready when you can\u2019t see any more sauce in the pan because the noodles have absorbed it. If it seems like it needs more, add a little more, and cook until it\u2019s absorbed. Taste.\n10 Add the peanuts and bean sprouts: Add the peanuts and the sprouts, and toss all ingredients together quickly. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes altogether until everything is heated through. The noodles will begin to soften and look more translucent.\n11 Taste and serve: Turn the heat off the pan and taste the to make sure there is enough sauce to flavor the dish.

Sprinkle the other ingredients evenly over top. Fold the meat over a few times to get everything incorporated. This entire process should only take about 30 to 45 seconds. Don\u2019t over handle the meat.\n\n2 Shape the burger patties: Rather than forming the patties in your hand, form them on a tray. This makes it easier to shape the patties without over-handling or warming the meat. I like to use a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, but any tray or platter will do.\nOn the tray, divide the meat into 6 equal parts (about 5 1/4 ounces each). Gently form each portion into a patty that is 4-inches across with 1-inch sides and a shallow depression in the middle (see photos below). You want the outer 1/2 inch of the patty to be slightly taller than the inside. This keeps the patty from shrinking too much and from puffing up in the center during grilling\nCover the patties with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge while you heat up your grill and butter your buns.\n\n3 Heat the grill: Heat a gas or charcoal grill to 450 to 500\u00b0F, or hot enough that you can only hold your hand above the grill grates for about 1 second.\nButter the insides of all the buns and set them near the grill.\n\n4 Grill the burgers: Place patties on the grill over direct heat.

Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.\n\nAfter 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.\n(Note that if you are using \"instant yeast\" instead of \"active yeast\", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)\n2 Make and knead the pizza dough: Using the mixing paddle attachment, mix in the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.\nKnead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.\nIf you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.\nThe dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.\n3 Let the dough rise: Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.\nAt this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.\nCover the dough with plastic wrap.\n\nFor a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F) for 1 1/2 hours.\nFor a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).\nThe longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.\nAfter the pizza dough has risen, you can freeze it to use later. Divide the dough in half (or the portion sizes you will be using to make your pizzas). Place on parchment paper or a lightly floured dish and place, uncovered, in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. Then remove from the freezer, and place in individual freezer bags, removing as much air as you can from the bags. Return to the freezer and store for up to 3 months.\nThaw the pizza dough in the refrigerator overnight or for 5 to 6 hours. Then let the dough sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before stretching it out in the next steps.\n1 Preheat pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet): Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475\u00b0F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.\n2 Divide the dough into two balls: Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.\n\nForm two round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).\n3 Prep toppings: Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.\nAbout a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.\n4 Flatten dough ball, and stretch out into a round: Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a slightly floured work surface.\nStarting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.\n\nLet the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter - 10 to 12 inches.\nTreat the dough gently!\nYou can also hold up the edges of the dough with your fingers, letting the dough hang and stretch, while working around the edges of the dough.\nIf a hole appears in your dough, place the dough on a floured surface and push the dough back together to seal the hole.\nUse your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker. Pinch the edges if you want to form a lip.\n5 Brush dough top with olive oil: Use your finger tips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Let rest another 10-15 minutes.\nRepeat with the second ball of dough.\n6 Sprinkle pizza peel with corn meal, put flattened dough on top: Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with corn meal.

Turn and cut off 2 or 3 more rows. Continue in this way until all the kernels are off all the cobs. Transfer to a large bowl.\n\n2 Scrape the cob to release the creamy milk from the corn: After you have removed the kernels, hold one cob over the rim of the bowl of corn, and use the back of the knife to rub across it, going back and forth, to release the pulpy corn milk into the bowl.\nRepeat with all the ears. You should be able to get about 1 tablespoon of corn milk per cob.

Flip the zip-top edge of the bag outward, forming a cuff around the bag. This helps the bag stay open and upright.\nFill a large bowl or stock pot with 4 or 5 inches of water. Lay out a kitchen towel.\n\n2 Make the teriyaki marinade: Whisk together the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, and vinegar for the marinade.\n\n3 Cut the salmon into 4 portions (if not already done). Aim for equal portions, though it's fine if they are different shapes. If you're buying at fish counter, you can also ask the person at the counter to do this for you.\n\n4 Season the salmon: Divide the garlic and ginger between the fillets (about 1 teaspoon of each per fillet). Use your fingers to spread the garlic and ginger evenly over the surface of the salmon. This step helps them stick to the surface of the salmon after the teriyaki marinade is added.\n\n5 Transfer the salmon to freezer bags: Slide one fillet into each bag. Usually the fillets fit in the bottom of the bag (as pictures), but it's fine if they are sideways.\n\n6 Add the marinade and seal the bag: Holding the bag upright, add about 3 tablespoons of marinade to the bag. Flip the cuff back up and seal the bag almost closed, leaving about an inch un-zipped.\nHolding the bag by the unzipped portion, submerge the bag in the pot of water. Use your other hand to gently press out any air pockets from around the salmon. Lower the bag right up to the unzipped portion so that all the air bubbles are forced out, then pinch the bag closed.\nLift the bag out of the water; the plastic should hug the sides of the salmon, pressing right up against the fish. If it doesn't, or if you see any big air bubbles around the salmon, repeat sealing the bag. (Read more here.)\nTransfer the bag to the kitchen towel and pat dry. Repeat with adding the marinade and sealing the remaining freezer bags of salmon.\n\n7 Cook or freeze the salmon: If desired, skip to the next step and cook the salmon right away. Otherwise, freeze the salmon overnight or up to 3 months. The marinade will become opaque but may not completely solidify; this is normal. Even if you plan on eating the salmon within a few days, I'd recommend freezing it so that the fish doesn't over-marinate.\n\n8 When ready to cook, heat the sous vide bath: Fill a large pot with at least 6 inches of water. Add the Joule (or other sous vide device) and heat the water to 122F.\n\n9 Cook the fish: Once the sous vide bath is heated, add as many salmon fillets as you'd like to cook. (Do not thaw frozen salmon.) It's fine if the tops of the bags poke out from the surface of the water, but the salmon itself should be completely submerged. Add additional water if needed to cover.\nCook fresh (unfrozen) salmon for about 40 minutes, or cook frozen salmon for 70 minutes. Salmon can be left in the sous vide bath for up to 30 minutes after the end of cooking without significant change in flavor or texture (after 30 minutes, it starts to get a little mushy).\nWhen done, pull all the bags from the water and lay them on a kitchen towel. Pat the bags dry.\n\n10 Make the teriyaki sauce: Holding the bag over a microwave-safe measuring cup, snip one of the corners of the bag and empty the teriyaki marinade into the cup. Add water as needed so that you have 1/4 cup of liquid for every salmon fillet you have prepared. Whisk in 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch for every 1/4 cup of liquid.\nMicrowave on high in 30 second bursts, whisking between each burst, until the sauce thickens and bubbles around the edges (about 30 seconds for each quarter cup). If it doesn't seem to be thickening, whisk in another 1/4 teaspoon of cornstarch for each 1/4 cup and continue heating.\n\n11 Serve the salmon: While the sauce is heating, slide each salmon fillet out of its bag and onto a plate. If you'd like crispy skin (optional), warm a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and sear the salmon, skin-side down, for a few minutes or until the skin is browned and crispy.\nTransfer each fillet to a plate, drizzle each one with sauce, and sprinkle with sliced green onions or chopped cilantro.

Make sure the chicken is in a single layer.\n\n3 Seal the bag: Seal the bag with as little air as possible by using water-displacement method to help press out all the air: Just slowly lower the bag with the chicken into the water, letting the pressure of the water press the air through the top of the bag. Once the top of the bag reaches the water line and all the air has been pressed out, seal the bag. (Read more here.)\nYou can do this in the pot of water as it heats. (Just be careful if the water is already steaming!) Set the chicken aside on a kitchen towel until the water has finished heating. Seal it when it is submerged so most of the air is out of the bag.\n\n4 Cook the chicken: Once the water has come to temperature, submerge the sealed bag of chicken.

The last minute or two, uncover the pot and increase the heat to high to reduce the sauce a bit.\n2 Prep the salmon: While the sauce is cooking, rinse the salmon in cold water and check for any stray scales (if skin-on). Use needle nose pliers to remove any pin bones. Pat the fish dry with paper towels.\n3 Cook the salmon fillets: Add the oil to a saut\u00e9 pan large enough to fit the fillets in one layer. Heat the pan on high and let the pan heat up for 90 seconds.\nYou can either lay the fillets in the pan skin-side down or skin-side up. If you lay the fillets down skin-side down, this will help crisp up the skin which is great to eat (try it, if you haven't, it tastes like salmon bacon!).\nIf you lay the fillets down skin-side up first, the fillets will be easier to turn over without falling apart, because the raw skin helps hold the fillet together.

Sprinkle it with salt all over and let it sit, loosely wrapped in the butcher paper. Roasts should be brought close to room temperature before they go into the oven, to ensure more even cooking.\n2 Tie roast with kitchen string: If your butcher hasn't already done so, cut the bones away from the roast and tie them back on to the roast with kitchen string. This will make it much easier to carve the roast, while still allowing you to stand the roast on the rib bones while cooking.\n3 Preheat oven, season roast: Preheat your oven to 500\u00b0F (or the highest temp your oven reaches less than 500\u00b0F). Pat the roast dry with paper towels (pre-salting should have made the roast release some moisture), and sprinkle the roast all over with salt and pepper.\n\n4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer (oven proof) into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone.\n5 Brown roast at high temperature: Brown the roast at a 500\u00b0F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes.\n6 Lower oven temp to finish roasting: Reduce the oven temperature to 325\u00b0F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 11-12 minutes per pound for rare and 13-15 minutes per pound for medium rare.\nThe actual cooking time will depend on the shape of the roast, how chilled your roast still is when it goes into the oven, and your particular oven. A flatter roast will cook more quickly than a thicker one. A chilled roast will take more time than one closer to room temp.\nThere are so many variables involved that affect cooking time, this is why you should use a meat thermometer. A prime rib roast is too expensive to \"wing it\". Error on the rare side, you can always put the roast back in the oven to cook it more if it is too rare for your taste.\nRoast in oven until thermometer registers 115\u00b0F for rare or 120\u00b0-130\u00b0F for medium. (The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise after you take the roast out of the oven.)\nCheck the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer an hour before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 hours of total cooking time for rare (15 minutes at 500\u00b0 and 1 3/4 hours at 325\u00b0). In this case, check after 1 hour 15 minutes of total cooking time, or 1 hour after you lowered the oven temp to 325\u00b0. (A benefit of using a remote thermometer is that you don't have to keep checking the roast, you'll be able to see exactly what the temperature is by looking at the thermometer outside of the oven.)\nIf the roast is cooking too quickly at this point, lower the oven temperature to 200\u00b0F.\n7 Let the roast rest: Once the roast has reached the temperature you want, remove it from the oven and place it on a carving board. Cover it with foil and let it rest for 30 minutes before carving. The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise while the roast is resting.\n8 Cut away strings, remove bones, slice roast: Cut away the strings that were used to hold the roast to the rack of rib bones. Remove the bones (you can save them to make stock for soup if you want.)\n\nThen, using a sharp carving knife, slice meat across the grain for serving, making the slices about 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch thick.\n\nMaking gravy\nTo make the gravy, remove the roast from the pan. Remove excess fat, leaving 1/4 cup of fat plus the browned drippings and meat juices in the roasting pan.\nPlace the roasting pan on the stove top on medium high heat. Use a metal spatula to scrape up drippings that might be sticking to the pan.\nWhen the fat is bubbly, sprinkle 1/4 cup of flour over the fat and drippings in the pan.\nStir with a wire whisk to incorporate the flour into the fat. Let the flour brown (more flavor that way and you don't have the taste of raw flour in your gravy.)\nSlowly add 3 to 4 cups of water, milk, stock, or beer to the gravy. Continue to cook slowly and whisk constantly, breaking up any flour lumps.\nThe gravy will simmer and thicken, resulting in about 2 cups of gravy. (If you want less gravy, start with less fat and flour, and add less liquid.)\nSeason the gravy with salt and pepper and herbs to taste.

It can be refrigerated, or not\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n2 Make the sauce: In a shallow bowl, whisk together 2 teaspoons of salt, vinegar, tamarind concentrate, and sugar until smooth. Taste. Adjust the sauce as needed; you may need to add more salt depending on the other ingredients. Add a pinch of paprika or cayenne powder for color.\nYou\u2019ll only need about 1/2 cup of sauce for this recipe (1/4 cup per batch). Any extra sauce can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 months or used on leftovers.\n3 Bring a large pot of water to boil.\n4 Divide all of your ingredients into two batches. Arrange them near your stove. You\u2019ll prepare each batch completely, one after the next.\nWORKING ONE BATCH AT A TIME:\n5 Cook the tofu: Heat a wok or other large pan with high sides over high heat, which you will maintain throughout cooking the pad Thai. Add 2 tablespoons of oil. When it starts to shimmer a bit, it\u2019s ready.\nAdd the tofu for your first batch to the pan and let it get some color on it, about 2 to 3 minutes. Toss it frequently once you\u2019ve got some browning on one side. You won\u2019t get browning on all sides. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, and then remove the tofu to a plate. Set aside.\n\n6 Cook the eggs: Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil to the pan. When the oil starts to shimmer a bit, it\u2019s ready.\nCrack the eggs for this batch into the pan and, using the tip of a wooden spoon, gently loosen the yolk. There should be enough oil in the pan so it looks as though the egg is floating, or suspended, in the oil. This gives you more surface area to cook the egg without it burning.\nGently shake and flip the egg around in the pan. Break it up a bit with the spoon, but don\u2019t scramble it by any means. This should take about a minute.\nPush the eggs off to the side of the pan to make room for the tofu. Add the tofu back to the pan.\n\n7 Soften the noodles: Take several handfuls of your noodles (about half the total amount) out of the water they\u2019re soaking in, and transfer to a fine mesh sieve. Using the sieve saves you from having to cook and then strain the noodles\u2014and makes the process move more quickly.\nHold the sieve over the pot of hot water and gently dip the noodles up and down, in and out of the water, to soften them but not cook them per se. They don\u2019t need to be completely cooked at this point, because they will continue to cook in the wok.\nShake out the excess hot water and taste to make sure the noodles have softened but still have a little give.\n\n8 Add the noodles to the pan: Transfer the noodles to the hot pan. Toss them gently in the pan and stir them briefly to keep them from sticking together. When the noodles look shiny, after about a minute or so, it\u2019s time for the sauce.\n9 Add the sauce: Add about 1/4 cup of the sauce to the pan and gently toss and flip the noodles in the pan. Stir them quickly to integrate the sauce; you\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready when you can\u2019t see any more sauce in the pan because the noodles have absorbed it.\nIf it seems like it needs more, add a little more, and cook until it\u2019s absorbed. Taste. (Pad Thai is very much an intuitive, taste-as-you-go kind of dish.) This shouldn\u2019t take more than a minute or two.\n10 Add the peanuts and bean sprouts: Add the peanuts and the sprouts, and toss all ingredients together quickly. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes all together until everything is heated through. The noodles will begin to soften and look more translucent.\n11 Taste and serve: Turn the heat off the pan and taste to make sure there is enough sauce to flavor the dish. Serve immediately in individual bowls with wedges of lime, along with additional peanuts, chopped cilantro, and chili flakes, if desired.\n12 Repeat steps 5 through 11 for making the second batch of pad Thai.\n"}, {"title": "Spinach-Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms", "total_time": 40, "ingredients": ["1/2 pound cremini or button mushrooms, halved", "2 large shallots (4 ounces), quartered", "4 large portobello mushrooms", "4 tablespoons olive oil, divided", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "5 ounces (about 4 cups) baby spinach leaves", "1 tablespoon water", "1 teaspoon dried thyme", "3 tablespoons sour cream", "1 cup (about 4 ounces) grated Swiss, Gouda, or cheddar cheese", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley (for garnish)"], "instructions": "1 Get your equipment ready: Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Set a large strainer over a bowl.\n2 Chop the mushrooms and shallots: Remove the stems from the portobello mushroom caps. With a paring knife, trim the dirty ends of the stems, and discard. Rinse what remains of the stems, and cut them into 1-inch pieces.\nIn a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine the cremini or button mushrooms, shallots, and portobello mushroom stems. Pulse several times until the mushrooms and shallots are finely chopped. Set aside.\n\n3 Bake the mushrooms on their own: Brush both sides of the mushroom caps with 2 tablespoons of the oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place them on the baking sheet with the gill side down, and bake for 12 to 14 minutes, or until tender but still a little firm.\nRemove and set aside. There will probably be quite a bit of excess liquid on the pan; reserve it to add to the filling in step 5.\n4 Cook and drain the spinach: Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the spinach and 1 tablespoon of water to the pan. Cook and stir for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the leaves wilt.\nTransfer them to the strainer and let drain, pressing out most of the liquid with the back of a spoon. Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel.\n\n5 Finish the filling: Over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the skillet. Add the chopped mushrooms and shallots and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened.\nAdd the thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 2 pinches of pepper, and any excess liquid that accumulated on the baking sheet while baking the portobellos. Cook and stir until most of the liquid in the pan evaporates.\nRemove the pan from the heat. Add the drained spinach and sour cream, and stir until combined. Taste and add more salt and pepper if you like.\n\n6 Stuff the mushrooms: Turn the mushrooms on the baking sheet so that the gill side is up. Mound a quarter of the filling on top of each mushroom cap. Sprinkle each with a quarter of the cheese.\n7 Broil the stuffed mushrooms: Set a rack 6 inches from the broiler element, and heat the broiler. Place the mushrooms under the broiler, and broil for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the cheese melts.\n8 Serve: Sprinkle with chopped parsley, and serve the mushrooms on top of greens dressed lightly in oil and vinegar, or with rice, farro, or the grain of your choice."}, {"title": "Sous Vide French Dip Sandwiches", "total_time": 45, "ingredients": ["3 pounds boneless beef top or bottom round roast", "1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste", "1 to 3 tablespoons cooking oil, like canola or grapeseed", "1/2 cup red wine", "2 cups low-sodium beef broth or stock", "1 bay leaf", "1 large yellow onion, or 2 small yellow onions, thinly sliced (1 to 1 1/4 pounds)", "6 to 8 French rolls or hoagie buns", "Sliced provolone cheese, optional", "Joule immersion circulator, or other immersion circulator", "Large (8-quart or more) stock pot", "Name-brand 1-gallon resealable plastic freezer bag, such as Ziploc"], "instructions": "1 Calculate your cooking time: This roast cooks sous vide for 18 to 24 hours, so it's important to begin cooking with your serving time in mind. Calculate backward from your dinner time to figure out when you should start cooking the roast.\nFor make-ahead instructions if you don't plan on serving your sandwiches right away, see the instructions in the headnotes.\n2 Trim and season the roast: Trim any large pieces of fat from the exterior of the roast, but don't worry about getting every last speck. Season it on all sides with the salt and pepper.\n\n3 Sear the roast: Warm a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. When the oil shimmers and glides smoothly, and a flick of water evaporates on contact with the pan, add the roast.\nSear the roast very well on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. The seared surfaces should look dark reddish-brown. If the oil starts to get smoky, lower the heat slightly; otherwise, maintain a medium-high heat for the best sear.\n\n4 Transfer the seared beef to a plate to cool slightly. If the roast is still scorching hot from the pan when you put it in the plastic bag, it can melt a hole in the plastic.\n\n5 Deglaze the pan with the wine: With the pan still over medium-high heat, add the wine all at once. It will bubble and steam as it hits the pan. As it bubbles, use a stiff spatula to scrape up any dark bits that were stuck.\nOnce you've scraped up all the bits and the wine is simmering, pour it carefully into a measuring cup. Let it cool slightly.\n\n6 Pack up the roast for sous vide cooking: Place a 1-gallon plastic freezer bag on your counter and fold the top outwards to form a cuff; this will help it stand up and make it easier to fill. (Alternatively, place the bag in a bowl while filling).\nPlace the slightly cooled roast into the bag. Pour the wine and broth over top, and tuck the bay leaf inside. Zip the bag almost entirely shut, leaving about an inch open at one edge.\n7 Seal the bag: Fill a large stock pot three-quarters full with water. Submerge the bag with the roast until just the zipper part of the bag is above the water.\nAs you submerge the bag, the pressure of the water will press the sides of the plastic bag up against the roast and the liquid, \"hugging\" the ingredients. You may need to use your hands or a spatula to poke the roast below the surface of the water and force out any bubbles.\nOnce all the air bubble are out, submerge the bag up to the zipper, then zip it all the way closed so the bag is sealed. Lift the roast from the water and place it on a dishtowel while you heat the water.\nAs you lift the bag, the plastic should look like it's hugging the ingredients inside the bag. A few small air pockets are fine; vacuum-sealing isn't necessary. Check carefully to make sure the bag isn't leaking; if it is, transfer it to a new bag and repeat this sealing step.\n\n8 Heat the water with the immersion circulator: Place the pot of water on a trivet or other heatproof surface. Place the immersion circulator in the water and set it to heat the water based on your preferred doneness for the roast beef: 135\u00b0F (medium-rare), 140\u00b0F (medium), 145\u00b0F (medium-well) or 150\u00b0F (well-done).\nIt will take approximately 5 to 10 minutes for the water to heat, depending on the volume of water in your pot. (You can also use warm water out of the tap to cut down on heating time.) Once the water is up to temp, your immersion circulator will indicate that you're ready to start cooking.\nWith Joule, this is controlled through the Joule app: Open the app on your phone and press the orange circular button in the bottom right corner. Input the temperature and press the orange button again to start the device and begin heating the water.\n\n9 Cook the roast: Once the water has finished heating, lower the roast into the water. It's fine if the zipper is above the surface of the water, but the roast itself should be completely submerged by at least an inch or so. Add more water if needed.\nCook the roast for 18 to 24 hours (yes, hours!). It will become more tender the longer you let it cook. Set a timer so you know when it's ready.\n\n10 Check the roast and monitor the water during cooking: Every so often during cooking, take a peek at your roast and make sure that it's still submerged in the water and the bag isn't leaking. (If it's leaking, the liquid will start to look diluted and you'll notice air bubbles in the bag. Just transfer the roast and liquid to another bag and carry on with cooking. This doesn't happen very often, but is something to watch out for.)\nKeep an eye on the water level and add additional water if it looks like it's getting low. The immersion circulator will heat the water right back up to temperature. To help prevent evaporation, you can also cover your pot with plastic wrap, a silicon bowl cover (as I have), or any other cover.\n\n11 Cook the onions at any point while the roast is cooking: At any point during this cooking time when you have a spare 10 minutes, cook the onions. Warm a teaspoon or two of oil in a skillet and cook the onions with 1/4 teaspoon salt until they are very soft and browned.\nIf you're not serving them right away, cool and refrigerate until needed. To reheat, add them to a hot skillet and stir until warmed through.\n\n12 Sear the roast (again!): When you're done cooking the roast, lift the bag from the water and set it on a kitchen towel on the counter. Warm a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.\nOpen the bag with the roast; be careful not to spill any of the cooking liquid. Use tongs to lift the roast from the bag and transfer it to a cutting board. Pat it dry on all sides.\nTransfer the roast to the hot skillet and sear on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side, until the outside is very crusty. Add more oil as needed to the pan. Once seared, set the roast on a cutting board until ready to slice.\n\n13 Strain the \"jus\": While the roast sears, strain the cooking liquid (\"jus\") into a measuring cup. Taste and add salt or pepper if needed. If the jus seems overly concentrated to you, add a little water to thin it out again.\nUse a little of the jus to deglaze the pan after searing the roast, if you like.\nTransfer the jus to individual cups for serving.\n\n14 Toast the French rolls: Warm the oven to 400F. Open up all the French rolls and arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet with the cut sides facing up. Toast in the hot oven until they are warm and feel crispy when you press the surface of the bread, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, but leave the oven on.\nIf you like, spoon a little of the beef jus over the bottom buns for flavor.\n\n15 Slice the beef: Use a sharp chef's knife and slice the beef against the grain as thinly as possible.\n\n16 Assemble the sandwiches: Pile slices of beef on the bottom half of the rolls. The meat should divide equally between all the rolls, but you may have some leftover.\nTop each pile of beef with some onions and a slice or two of cheese, if desired.\n\n17 Broil the sandwiches: Set aside the tops of the buns so they don't burn. Switch the oven to \"broil\" and slide the pan of sandwiches under the broiler. Broil until the cheese starts to melt, about 1 minute.\n\n18 Serve the sandwiches: Top each sandwich with the top bun.

(This is the hard part.) Sometimes the skins easily rub off. I have found that usually, for us, the skins don't easily peel off and we need to blanch them for one minute in boiling water first, to loosen the skins. If you blanch the walnuts, let them cool to the touch and carefully peel off as much of the bitter skins as you can. This is painstaking work, but unless your walnuts are shed of their bitter skins, the sauce may be a bit bitter.\n\n2 Place the walnuts in a bowl, cover them with milk to soak, and chill them overnight in the refrigerator.\n\nTHE DAY OF\nRoast the chiles:\n\n3 Place the chiles directly over the flame of a gas stove, or place under a hot broiler, to char the outside tough skin. Turn the chiles to char them on all sides. Get as much of the outside skin blackened as possible, it will be easier to remove that way. (See How to roast chile peppers over a gas flame tutorial using Anaheim chiles.)\n\n4 Place the blackened chiles in a bowl and cover with a plate or damp clean towel and let sit for 20 minutes. The burned skin will then flake off very easily and the flesh will become a little more cooked in the steam. Make a slit in the side of each chili and carefully remove the seeds and veins. Be careful to leave the top of the chili, the part around the base of the stem, intact. (A tip from Diana Kennedy: if you taste the chiles and they are too spicy hot, soak them in a mild vinegar and water solution for about 30 minutes.) Rinse the chilies and pat them dry.\n\nMake the walnut sauce:\n\n5 Drain the walnuts.

Working in batches to prevent crowding the pan, brown the meat on at least one side, sprinkling the meat with a little kosher salt as it cooks. Add another tablespoon of oil if needed for the subsequent batches. Remove meat to a bowl and set aside.\n\n7 Add a tablespoon of cooking oil to the pan and heat on medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft. Add the cinnamon, black pepper, cloves, and garlic and cook another minute.\n\n8 Melt butter in the pan and return the ground meat to the pan and use a wooden spoon to break up any clumps. Add the crushed tomatoes, golden raisins, and chopped slivered almonds. If the mixture seems a little dry, add a tablespoon or two of water. Add chopped apple to the picadillo mixture. Adjust spices, add more cinnamon, salt, ground cloves to taste (go easy on the cloves, they can overpower).\n\nAssemble the chiles en nogada:\n10 Stuff the chilies with the picadillo until they are well filled out.

Rub the rosemary mixture all over the duck and some in the cavity.\nTie the legs together loosely. Put in a plastic bag and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.\n2 Roast the duck breast side up: At least a half an hour before you plan to cook the duck, remove from the refrigerator so it can get to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Place the duck on a roasting rack in a roasting pan, breast side up. Pour a cup of water into the pan. Roast for 45 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and pour off the fat and water. Separate the fat to use for basting.\n3 Finish roasting the duck breast side down: Turn the bird on the rack so now the breast is facing down. Baste the bird with the fat. Return the bird to the oven. Increase the temperature to 400\u00b0F. Estimate a total cooking time of 15 minutes per lb of bird. So if you have a 4 lb duck, cook it another 30 minutes.\nThe bird is done when the juices run clear from a thigh pricked all the way down to the joint and when a meat thermometer inserted in the inner thigh below the leg joint reads 175 to 180 degrees.

You can score the fat to as deep as where the fat meets the meat. If you want you can first cut off any skin that might still be on the ham, but it isn't necessary.\n\n3 Insert cloves (if using): If using cloves (with the Sweet Honey Mustard Glaze), you can either put them in before applying the glaze or after. They look better if applied after, but it is easier to see the lines in the ham as a guide for placement if you put them in first.\nPlace the cloves in the center of the diamonds to form a nice pattern around the top and sides of the ham (or along the edges of some of the precut slices if using spiral cut). Some people put the cloves in the intersection points of the scores. Do as you wish. You just want a nice pattern.\n\n4 Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F.\n5 Prepare glaze:\nIf using the sweet honey mustard glaze, mix the mustard with the brown sugar in a small bowl.\nIf using the honey thyme glaze, mix thyme in with the hot melted butter and let sit for a few minutes. In a small saucepan on high heat, let the cider vinegar reduce down from 1/4 cup to 1 Tbsp, remove from heat. Whisk in the butter and thyme. Add the honey, the brown sugar, and the Worcestershire sauce.\n6 Apply glaze: Using a pastry brush, brush whichever glaze you are using over the ham. Only use about third of the glaze (reserve the rest for later in cooking). Try to work the glaze into the scored lines.\n\n7 Bake in oven: Place ham in oven. (If using a spiral cut ham, first wrap tightly in aluminum foil so that the ham doesn't dry out while cooking.) Cook for about 1 1/2 hours (check after 1 hour, will take longer if the ham is not at room temp to begin with), or about 10 minutes per pound, until the internal temperature of the ham is 110\u00b0-120\u00b0 (use a meat thermometer). (Note that the ham is already cooked when you buy it, all you are trying to do is heat it up for eating.)\nIf using a non-spiral cut ham, baste the ham with the glaze a couple of times during the cooking. If you check on the ham and think that the glaze is at risk of getting too browned (like on the way to burnt), you can cover with a piece of foil.\n8 Baste and broil: When the ham has reached the desired temperature, baste again. If using a spiral cut ham, open up the foil to expose the ham before basting.\nPlace the ham under the broiler for few minutes to get some nice browning on the top. Take the pan out of the oven and brush the ham all over with pan juices. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 15 minutes before serving.\n9 Slice: To slice a bone-in ham, cut around the bone first. Then use a long, sharp knife to slice off pieces around the bone.\nAnother way to slice the ham is to make first a slice on wide end to get a flat lying surface.

Season the outside of the balls with salt and pepper.\n3 Add the patties to the pan and press: Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the beef balls one at a time, pressing each one by covering it with foil and pressing down to flatten with a second small pan or skillet. Try to get the patty as even as possible. For double burgers, you are looking for a very thin patty. For single burgers, shoot for about 1/3-inch thick patty.\nRepeat with pressing each of the patties in the pan, reusing the same piece of foil.\n4 Cook the patties: Cook patties for 2 minutes for the thinner double patties, or 3 to 4 minutes for the thicker single patties. Flip, top with cheese, and cook until the cheese is melted, another 2 to 3 minutes.\nThe patties will shrink a bit as they cook. It\u2019s okay to press on them a bit with your spatula to reshape them slightly, but try to keep a light touch, or you will push out all the juices.\n\n4 Assemble the burgers: When your burger patties are cooked through and the cheese is very melted, smear the bottom bun with 1 to 2 tablespoons of burger sauce and top with lettuce.

Pat the pork dry with paper towels, then sprinkle with half of the spice rub. Turn and rub the spice into the pork until the pieces are evenly coated.\nLeave the pork to absorb the rub and to take the chill off the meat, at least 15 minutes or up to an hour. (Room temperature pork will sear better!)\n\n2 Sear the pork: Select the \u201cSaut\u00e9\u201d program on your pressure cooker and add the oil to the pot. (If you are using a stovetop pressure cooker, heat the oil over medium heat.)\nUse a pair of tongs to lower the pork into the pot so the side with the most fat is facing down. Sear for 5 minutes. Flip it over and sear it for 5 more minutes. Both sides should be browned.\n\n3 Sprinkle the remaining spice rub over the pork, then pour the pineapple juice over the top.\n\n4 Cook the pork: Place the lid on your pressure cooker. Make sure that the pressure regulator is set to the \u201cSealing\u201d position. Select the \u201cManual\u201d program on the pressure cooker and set the time to 50 minutes at high pressure.

(For stovetop pressure cookers, perform a quick pressure release.)\n\n6 Separate the pork and cooking liquid: Use tongs to transfer the pork to a large baking dish or sheet pan. Use heat-proof mitts to lift the inner pot out of the pressure cooker, pour the cooking liquid into a fat separator, then pour the liquid back into the pot. Reserve the fat.\n(Alternatively, let the cooking liquid stand for about 10 minutes until the fat floats to the top, then use a shallow spoon to skim as much fat as possible from the surface.)\n\n7 Reduce the cooking liquid: Return the pot to the pressure cooker, select the \u201cSaut\u00e9\u201d program, and let the cooking liquid reduce for 10 minutes. (If you are using a stovetop pressure cooker, do the same thing over medium heat.)\n\n8 While the liquid is reducing, use a pair of forks to shred the pork.\n9 Broil the pulled pork until crispy (optional for carnitas): To make crispy carnitas, place the pan of shredded pork 6 to 8 inches below the broiler and broil for 5 to 10 minutes until the tips and edges of the pork are browned and crispy.\nIt's fine to skip this step if you're making a recipe where you don't need the pork to be crispy.\n\n10 Toss the shredded pork with the reduced liquid and serve: Return the pork to the pot with the reduced cooking liquid and toss to coat the pork evenly.

Inspect duck to see if there are any remaining pin feathers, if so, remove them.\nRinse the duck with water. Thoroughly pat dry with paper towels.\nLightly stuff duck with a sprig of rosemary, an apple slice with a few cloves poked in them to hold them in place, and a small wedge of onion.\n\n2 Slather the duck inside and out with olive oil. Sprinkle all sides of the duck with coarse salt.\n3 Roast the duck breast side up: Lay the duck breast up, on a roast rack in a roasting pan. Place in the middle rack of the 450\u00b0F oven. Immediately lower the heat to 425\u00b0F.\n\nCooking times depend on the variety of the duck. Teal ducks typically weigh less than a pound and cook in 10-15 minutes. According to the Joy of Cooking a mallard can take up to 25 minutes. Our duck was perfectly done at 13 minutes. Another duck we cooked for 17 minutes was slightly overdone.\nMeat thermometers are often not very useful with the small fowl because there isn't enough flesh to put the thermometer into. But if you have an instant read thermometer and can get a good read, my pal Hank suggests cooking until the duck reaches an internal temp of 135\u00b0F. If you error on the rare and underdone side, you can always put the bird back in the oven for a few more minutes if it isn't done enough.\nIf you aren't using a meat thermometer, to test for doneness you can take the bird out of the oven and cut a part of it with the tip of a sharp knife. Note that the juices will run RED, and the meat will be quite red. You want the meat to be rare (wild duck only); it should look like a rare (not raw) steak. The more the meat is cooked beyond the rare stage, the more \"livery\" or gamey it will taste.\n4 Let rest: Remove the duck from the oven and remove to a separate rack or plate to rest, breast side down, for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the stuffing in the cavity before serving.\n\n5 Make gravy with the drippings: While the duck is resting, if there are drippings in the roasting pan, pour off the excess fat (save this wonderful fat for another recipe).\nPlace the roasting pan on the stovetop, heat to medium, and deglaze with a little dry sherry or white wine.\nScrape up the browned bits with a metal spatula. Use a metal whisk to break up the bits even further into the wine.\nReduce and then add a little cream, (and a few juniper berries if you want an extra touch). Pour off into a gravy serving dish or little bowl.\n6 Serve: Serve ducks with wild rice and gravy. Teal ducks are single serving ducks.\nNote that you can get excellent stock from the duck carcass. Put the duck carcasses in a saucepan, cover with an inch of cold water, bring to a simmer, lower the heat to barely-a-bubble-simmer covered, and cook for 3 hours.

Prepare the rub. Mix all the ingredients for the rub together, breaking up any clumps. Taste the rub as you make it and see if you like the taste, adjust accordingly.\n\n2. Rub the roast with the rub. Unwrap the pork roast and place it on its butcher paper or in a roasting pan, something that can catch the rub. With your (clean) hands work the rub mixture into the pork shoulder all over, including inside any crevasses you may find in a boneless roast where the bone had been. Be generous with the amount of rub.\nRewrap it in the butcher paper or wrap it in plastic and place it in a pan (to catch any liquid that may drip out), and refrigerate it overnight.\n\nThe night before:\n3. Soak the wood chips. Take 3 or 4 large handfuls of wood chips (hickory, oak, apple or other fruit wood) and place them in a bowl and cover them with water to soak them overnight (can also do for an hour before using).\nI think it helps to have a mix of sizes, from small chips to larger (1-inch x 2-inch) chunks. The smaller chips will get smoking more quickly, but will burn out more quickly too. The larger chunks will take longer to catch, but last well past when the smaller chips have burned themselves out.\n\nThe Day Of:\n4. Bring the chilled roast to room temp. 1 to 2 hours before you start the barbecue, take the pork out of the refrigerator to come to room temperature.\n\nNow, if you forget to do this, which I have done, you can still go ahead and BBQ it. You'll likely be finishing it in the oven anyway. It will just take a bit longer to cook.\n5. Prepare your grill. Remove one of the grill grates. This will be your \"hot\" side, where the wood chips will go. The other side of the grill will be the \"cool\" side, and where the meat will be, away from direct heat.\nDepending on the structure of your grill, you may want to remove the \"flavor bar\", the thin metal piece with lots of holes in it that sits over the burner. The wood chips will smoke more easily if they lay in a (fireproof metal or foil) container directly on the burner.\n\n6. Place a tray of water on the grill: If there is room on your grill, place a small aluminum tray of water on the grill to help moderate the heat and help keep the roast from getting too dry. A good place to place this is on an upper rack if you grill has one.\n\n7. Get the grill smoking. Create a double layered aluminum foil boat with a handful or two of damp wood chips in it.\nPlace the boat directly on the burner on the \"hot\" side of the grill if you can (otherwise place on the flavor bar). Turn the grill on to medium flame, cover the grill and let it heat up until the the wood chips start smoking.\nYou'll either see smoke coming out of the grill, or if you raise the lid, you'll see smoke coming out of the wood chip boat. You should see and smell the smoke.\nYou'll be replenishing the wood chips periodically for the next several hours so put more dry chips into water to soak if needed.\n\n8. Cook roast on cool side of grill, fat side up: Once the grill is smoking, place the roast on the grill grates on the cool side of the grill, away from direct heat. If your grill has a hot spot, position the roast away from it. If there is a fatty side to the meat, put that side facing up; the fat will render over time and baste the pork.\nCover the grill, lower the flame, and let the cooking begin. The temperature you want to maintain ideally is 225\u00b0F. Try to keep it close to that temperature, within a range of 210\u00b0F to 240\u00b0F. If the temperature goes too high, the roast may dry out. If it's too low, it will take forever to cook.\n\n9. Maintain the smoke and the 225\u00b0F temperature. This is the tricky part. You will want to maintain smoke in the grill for at least 4 hours (6 hours for a bigger roast). You will also want to maintain a cooking temperature of around 225\u00b0. So, you have to check the grill!\nCheck if the temperature is being maintained between 210\u00b0F and 240\u00b0F, and check to make sure the chips are still producing smoke, every half hour. About once an hour you will likely need to replenish the chip boat with more wood chips.\nResist the temptation to open the grill more than once an hour. Every time you open the grill the inside temperature drops and you increase your overall cooking time.\n\nI found the best way to check the temperature, since I don't have a gauge in the grill itself, is to put an instant read meat thermometer into an opening in the hood on the meat side (cool side) of the grill, and just keep checking it. Make sure sensor tip of the probe is not touching the meat itself.\nYou want to avoid opening up the hood too often, because every time you do that, you lose heat. Of course, if your gas grill gets too hot, opening the hood can cool it down quickly.\nExpect a minimum cooking time, if you have been diligent at maintaining a 225\u00b0F, of 90 minutes per pound. So if you are cooking a 4 pound roast, total cooking time will be at least 6 hours (and easily more). An 8 pound roast will take at least 12 hours of cooking time.\nIf you want to cook 8 pounds of pork shoulder more quickly, I recommend starting with two 4 pound roasts, spaced on the grill a few inches apart, which will cook in just a little more time than an 8 pound roast.\n10 Reposition the roast: After 2 or 3 hours, during one of your hourly opening of the grill to refresh the wood chips, reposition the roast so that the side that was closest to the heat is now furthest from the heat.\n11. Test internal temperature of meat. After about 5 hours, start taking the pork's internal temperature: You can eat it at 165\u00b0F, but if you are making pulled pork the meat needs to be ideally 195\u00b0F.\n12 Remove from heat, let rest: When the meat reaches 195\u00b0F, remove it from the heat, tent it loosely with foil over a cutting board (to catch the juices) and let it rest for at least 30 minutes, and preferably 1 hour.\nIf after 6 hours of cooking, if the meat hasn't reached 195\u00b0 internal temp (usually after 6 hours, the internal temp on my roasts is about 155\u00b0F), my recommendation is to remove it from the grill and finish in the oven.\n\nTo finish in the oven, wrap the roast in aluminum foil to help prevent it from drying out in the oven, and place it in a roasting pan, in a 300\u00b0F oven.\nCook until the internal temperature of the roast reaches 195\u00b0F. If your starting internal meat temperature is 150\u00b0F or so, this can take anywhere from an hour to two hours.\nWhen it reaches temperature, remove the roast from the oven and let rest for at least 30 minutes, up to an hour.\n13. Pull the pork. Pull the pork with 2 forks. Only now do you add any barbecue sauce (and any accumulated juices) to the meat. Taste it first! It might not need sauce at all, and if it does, add only a little at a time. One of the biggest sins of barbecue is to over-sauce perfectly good meat.\n\nServe on a bun with or without sauce, and with or without coleslaw. Also great with grilled or raw pineapple."}, {"title": "Italian Sausage and Mushroom Risotto", "total_time": 55, "ingredients": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 pound Italian sweet sausage, removed from casings, crumbled", "1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, diced", "10 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, diced", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme", "1 1/2 cups Madeira (divided, 1/2 cup and 1 cup)", "6 cups chicken stock (use gluten-free stock if cooking gluten-free)", "1/2 cup (1 stick) butter", "1 large onion, chopped", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "2 cups arborio rice", "1/2 cup freshly grated Asiago or Parmesan cheese (for topping)"], "instructions": "1 Cook the sausage and mushrooms: Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium heat.

After the initial browning you will reduce the heat.\n5 Sear the lamb: Place the lamb, fat side down, on the grill on the hot side (double layer charcoals). You will get likely get flareups, so be prepared with a squirt bottle of water or a couple of cups of water (if using a charcoal grill) to control the flames if needed. (My brother Matt swears by shaking the bottle of beer he is drinking to squirt some beer on the coals when needed for flareups.)\nSear one side for 4 minutes, then flip the lamb over to sear the other side for another 4 minutes.\n\n6 Move to cool side of grill and finish cooking: If you are using a charcoal grill, move the roast to the less hot side of the grill.

Depending upon the size of your Dutch oven, you can probably fry 4 to 6 pieces at a time.\nFry the fish in batches so you don\u2019t bring down the temperature of the oil too much. Cook on each side for about 2 to 3 minutes, until the coating is a deep amber brown. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.\n\n8 Serve: Transfer the fish to a platter, serve alongside tortillas, slaw, and crema. Let everyone assemble their own tacos.

Drizzle in the olive oil while pur\u00e9eing, continue to pur\u00e9e until smooth, about 1-2 minutes.\nCoat the fish and veggies in the marinade. Set in the fridge for at least an hour and up to overnight.\n3 Thread onto skewers: When skewering the fish and vegetables, pierce the fish against the grain, and select pieces of veggies that are close to the same size as your fish. This is important, because if the pieces are different widths, some things will be charred and others undercooked.\nYou also want to be careful when loading up the skewers; it's easy to stab yourself by accident!\n\nAlternate pieces of fish with pieces of various veggies, leaving a little space between everything. Don\u2019t crowd the skewer, or the parts that are touching will cook too slowly.\nNote that by threading the skewers with assorted veggies and fish, some things will be cooked more or less than others, as some things take longer to cook than others.\nIf you want all of your items to be cooked perfectly, use a separate skewer for the onions, one for the tuna, one for the bell peppers, etc. Put the onions and bell peppers down first because they take longer to cook.\n4 Grill on high, direct heat: Prepare the grill for high, direct heat. Clean the grates and wipe them down with a paper towel that has been dipped in vegetable oil. Lay the skewers on the grill.\nDon't move them until the fish pieces are well browned on one side, about 3-6 minutes.\n\nThen using tongs, carefully turn the skewers over and cook them until they are seared on the other side.\nServe hot or at room temperature.

Note that Becca gets her shrimp fresh, not frozen, in the shell, and butterfly cut to make it easy to de-shell.\nAfter chopping up all the vegetables, de-shelling the shrimp takes a bunch of time because you want to make sure to get all of the shell pieces out. As you de-shell the shrimp, place the shrimp in a bowl of cold water.\nWhen you are done de-shelling, strain the water from the shrimp and put the shrimp in the refrigerator to stay cold. You will not add the shrimp to the jambalaya until the last 2 minutes of making this dish.\n2 Fry the sausage slices: In a large skillet, fry the sausage slices on medium heat, in batches, until cooked through, about 15 minutes for each batch.\n\nAs you finish each batch, pour out the sausage and whatever fat has been released into a large stockpot.\nThe size of the stockpot depends on how much jambalaya you are making. For a this batch, I would use an 8-Qt stockpot.\n3 Add Tony Chachere's, water, rice, chicken broth, onions, peppers, celery: Add Tony Chachere's Creole Jambalaya Dinner mix, and 2 1/4 cups of water for every 8 oz box used.\nAdd Uncle Ben's long grain rice and 2 1/4 cups of chicken broth for every cup of rice used.\nAdd onions, bell peppers, and celery. Slowly bring mixture to a simmer, on MEDIUM heat. This is slow cooking.\nYou want it on medium to prevent the jambalaya from burning. While the jambalaya is cooking, stir it every once in a while to make sure that nothing is sticking to the bottom.\n4 Add bay leaves, garlic, whole tomatoes (reserve juice), diced tomatoes, tomato sauce. Add thyme, tabasco, oregano, cayenne pepper, sugar. Slow cook on medium heat adding tomato juice and stock as needed, as the rice absorbs the liquid in the pot. You do not want it to get dried out, nor do you want it to be too liquid-y.\n\nAt this point, stir often to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom. Have the temperature be just a notch below a simmer. If it begins to boil, lower the heat, or add water. Cook slowly for an hour as the rice absorbs the liquid.\n\n5 Adjust seasonings: While the jambalaya is cooking, taste frequently and adjust seasonings. Becca likes her jambalaya pretty hot; she says, \"If you're not sweat'n, it's not hot enough!\" She adds Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning to bring up the heat. Add to taste.\n6 When the rice has absorbed as much moisture as it will, slowly fold in the shrimp. Add lemon juice (1/2 a lemon for each lb of shrimp). Cover and cook for 2 more minutes.

Add the water, then sprinkle with salt. Add the bay leaves and garlic.\n\n2 Pressure cook the chicken: Secure the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure that the pressure regulator is set to the \u201cSealing\u201d position. Select the \u201cPressure Cook\u201d or \u201cManual\u201d program, then adjust the time to 10 minutes at high pressure.\nThe pressure cooker will take about 10 minutes to come up to full pressure. Cook time begins once it has reached full pressure.\n\n3 Release the pressure: As soon as the timer goes off at the end of cooking, perform a quick pressure release by moving the pressure release knob from \u201cSealing\u201d to \u201cVenting.\u201d It will take a minute or two for the pressure to release completely.\nOpen the pot, then use a digital thermometer to check the thickest part of a piece of chicken\u2014it should be at least 165\u00baF. (If the chicken is not quite up to temperature, put the lid back on with the vent closed and cook for another minute or two.)\n\n4 Use the chicken: Use a pair of tongs to transfer the chicken to a dish, and let it rest for 10 minutes. Slice, shred, or cube the chicken as needed, or refrigerate in a lidded container for up to 5 days.\nIf you want to save the cooking liquid (it is now a lightly flavorful chicken broth), strain out the bay leaves and garlic.

Three days is a good length of time for this.\nWhen you are ready to cook, remove the roast from the marinade and sprinkle it all over with salt. Set it aside for 15-20 minutes or so.\n2 Preheat the oven to 275\u00b0F. Actually, 225\u00b0F is a better temperature, but the roast can take up to 8 hours to properly cook then; this is what I do at home on weekends. At 275\u00b0F, the roast will probably take about 5 hours to cook. You can go up to 300\u00b0F \u2013 a typical venison roast will be ready in 3 1/2 hours at this temperature \u2013 but you will get gray, not pink, meat. It will still taste good, though.\n3 Brown venison in butter or oil (optional): Now you have an optional step: You can, if you choose, brown the venison in butter or oil. I chose not to because if you then simmer the venison at a low enough temperature, it will remain pink all the way through. If you brown the outside, you will get a gray ring around the edge of the venison when you cut into it. Either way is fine.\n4 Cook the venison in the marinade: Pour the marinade into a Dutch oven or other lidded, oven-proof pot and bring it to a boil. Add the venison to the pot. Cover and put in the oven.\nIf the venison is not submerged by the marinade, turn the roast over every hour. This is also a good way to test for doneness \u2013 you want the roast to almost be falling apart.\nThe roast should take between 3 1/2 to 8 hours to cook, depending on the oven temperature. At 275\u00b0F, it should take about 5 hours to cook.\n5 Remove roast from oven and coat with oil or melted butter: When the roast is done (completely tender), take it out of the pot and coat it with some of the 1/4 cup olive oil or melted butter. Reserve the rest of the oil or butter for later. Wrap it in foil.\n6 Make the sauerbraten sauce: Sauerbraten is all about the sauce. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl.\nTake the 8 gingersnap cookies and pulverize them in a blender. You want it to look like a rough meal or coarse flour.\nIn a medium-sized pot, melt 3 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. When it is frothing and totally melted, whisk in 2 tablespoons flour. Cook the roux until it is the color of coffee-and-cream, stirring often.\nSlowly whisk in the strained cooking liquid, one cup at a time. The mixture will turn to clay at first, then loosen into a silky sauce.\nTaste for salt \u2013 it will probably need it \u2013 and add enough to your taste.\nWhisk in 4 tablespoons of the pulverized gingersnaps. They will not dissolve completely at first, but keep stirring and they will disappear.\nTaste the sauce. Add another tablespoon of gingersnaps if you want, or add a tablespoon of sugar.\nThe sauce should taste sour, warm (a pumpkin pie sort of spicy warm) and a little zippy and sweet.\n7 To serve, slice the roast into 1/4 inch thick slices. Venison can be dry \u2013 it has zero fat \u2013 so one trick I do is to coat each slice in melted butter before I serve it. You\u2019ll need about 1/2 stick melted to do this trick.\nServe with lots of sauce, some braised onions, and either mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or spaetzle.

Salt the turkey pieces well all over. Let sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes.\n2 Make the sauce: Saut\u00e9 the onions in butter until soft (but not browned), about 3-4 minutes on medium heat. Add the other sauce ingredients and simmer slowly, stirring occasionally, for at least 30 minutes.\n3 Prepare the grill: Prepare your grill for high direct heat on one side, and quite low indirect heat on the other side. To do this using a gas grill turn on only half of the burners. If using a charcoal grill, leave one side of your grill free of coals. If using a gas grill, preheat covered for at least 15 minutes.\nWhen the grill is hot, clean the grill grates with a grill grate scraper. Wipe down the grates with a paper towel soaked in oil.\n3 Sear the turkey pieces: Rub oil all over the turkey pieces. Lay the turkey pieces down on the hot grill, skin side down, to get an initial sear on the turkey.\nPay attention because the fat in the turkey may cause flare ups. If this happens be prepared to move the piece to a cooler side of the grill temporarily, or have a spay bottle of water on hand to douse the flames a bit if they get too high.\nSear the turkey on the skin side for 3-4 minutes.\n4 Move turkey pieces to cool side of the grill: Once the skin of a piece starts to get browned, move the piece to the cool side of the grill, turning it over so that the skin side is now up. This way the fat under the skin will melt into the meat, basting it, during the next slow-cooking phase.\n5 Cover and slow cook: Once you've moved all the turkey to the cool side of the grill, cover the grill and let the turkey slow-cook for 20 minutes without looking.\nCheck every 15-20 minutes after that, because everyone\u2019s grill is different. The turkey should cook for at least 1 1/2 hours after the initial sear, probably longer. (I think we cooked these pictured for 2 1/2 hours.) Barbecue by definition must be slow cooking over low heat.\n6 Brush with BBQ sauce: After about an hour, start to paint the turkey with the barbecue sauce. Paint only the top part (skin side) to start. Cover and wait another 20 minutes or so. Then flip the turkey over and paint the undersides.\nWhy wait? You want the sauce to sink in, adhere to the turkey and solidify a little; this way it will not drip down into the grill as much.\nCover and wait another 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n7 Test for doneness: Depending on how big your turkey pieces are, and your specific grill set up, the time it takes for your turkey pieces to be done will vary. To test for doneness you can insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh, not touching the bone.\nTake the turkey off the grill at 170\u00b0F to 175\u00b0F for thighs and legs, 165\u00b0F for breasts when tested with a meat thermometer. Or if you don't have a meat thermometer, cut into one of the pieces with a knife. The juices should run clear. If they run pink, the meat needs to be cooked longer.\nYou can continue to baste with the sauce every 15 minutes or so until the meat is done.\n8 Do a final sear on the skin-side: When the meat is just about ready to take off the grill, you can do a final sear on the skin side. Just place the pieces skin side down on the hot part of the grill. Watch it so that it just browns, not burns. It should take 1-2 minutes.\nServe with extra sauce, and plenty of napkins!"}, {"title": "Loaded Sheet Pan Nachos", "total_time": 17, "ingredients": ["1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 medium onion (about 1 cup), chopped", "1 pound ground beef (80-20 mix)", "1 teaspoon chili powder", "1 teaspoon coriander", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "3/4 teaspoon Morton kosher salt (maybe more)", "1 (16-ounce) bag tortilla chips, preferably thick and sturdy", "1 bell pepper, cored, halved and chopped (about 1 cup)", "1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained", "1 cup frozen corn", "1 (2.25-ounce) can sliced black olives, about 1/4 cup", "1 to 1 1/2 cups grated cheddar cheese or shredded Mexican cheese blend", "1 avocado, cubed", "2 scallions, green ends sliced thinly", "1 plum tomato, diced", "1/2 cup cilantro, chopped", "1 jalape\u00f1o pepper, seeded and thinly sliced", "1/3 cup sour cream", "1 cup sour cream", "Juice of one lime", "1/3 cup cilantro", "Pinch of salt"], "instructions": "1 Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.\n2 Cook the onions and beef: Heat the olive oil in a medium nonstick or cast iron skillet, and cook the onions for 5 minutes until they start to soften.\nAdd the beef, chili powder, coriander, oregano and kosher salt.

Pulse until completely blended.\nTransfer mixture to a large bowl, mix in the remaining ricotta and the Parmesan cheese. Stir a pinch of nutmeg into the flour.\nAdd the flour in by hand, starting with a half of the flour. Mix everything with your hands until the mixture holds together as a dough.\n3 Knead the dough: Put the dough out on a lightly floured smooth, clean surface. Knead lightly for about a minute, adding additional flour if needed, if the dough sticks too easily to the board or your hands. (At this point, if you wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for an hour, it will be easier to roll out.)\nWhen the dough is smooth and pliable, and still just a little bit sticky, divide it into 4 portions, each the size of an orange.\n4 Roll dough out into long ropes, cut into pieces: Flour your hands lightly. Using both hands, and a light touch, roll the dough out with a back and forth motion, starting at the center and stretching the dough out, to form a roll.\n\nThis is the tricky part. You don't want to put so much pressure so that you compress the dough, but you do need enough pressure to create a rope of dough.\nThe trick is to stretch the dough sideways as you are rolling. Once the segment you are working on gets to be about a foot long, you may find it easier to cut it in half, and then start working on that smaller segment.\n\nRoll the dough out until the roll is about the size of a middle finger. (Note that if your hands or the board is a little too floured, you may not have enough traction between your skin and the dough to easily stretch it sideways.) Cut each roll into 1-inch pieces.\n\n5 Create indentations with a fork: Hold a fork at a 45% angle with its tines facing down on the work board, the curved part of the fork facing away from you. Starting with the curved outside bottom of the fork, press each piece of dough up along the length of the tines. Let the gnocchi fall back down.\n\nThis is a pretty quick motion, the result is an indentation of the fork tines on one side of the gnocchi, and an indentation of your fingertip on the other side.\n\nPlace the gnocchi on a lightly floured cookie sheet. At this point they can be cooked, or kept in the refrigerator several hours or overnight.\n6 Cook the gnocchi in boiling water: To cook the gnocchi, fill a large wide pot half-way with water. Bring to a boil, add 1 teaspoon of salt for every quart of water.\nOnce the salt has dissolved, gently drop the gnocchi in the water, one by one. Try to do this in a way that the gnocchi are not falling in on top of each other, but rest on the bottom of the pan in a single layer.\nAs the gnocchi cooks, they will rise to the surface of the water after a couple minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the risen gnocchi from the pot, place in a serving bowl.\n\nSometimes the gnocchi can stick a little at the bottom. If you suspect this, nudge them a little to unstick them. As you remove some gnocchi, you can add a few more to the pan.\nThe Sauce\n1 While you are cooking the gnocchi, make the sauce. Heat oil in a medium saucepan on medium heat. Add the garlic cloves and cook until lightly browned on all sides. Remove and discard the garlic.\nAdd the tomatoes (include any juices from the can) all at once (careful, they may cause the oil to splatter as the tomatoes hit the pan). As soon as the mixture boils, reduce the heat to low and let simmer, uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt. Stir occasionally.

If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.\nUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.\nSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n\n2 Sear the brisket: You'll need an ovenproof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\nPat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\nTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\n\n3 Saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot. If not, add some olive oil.\nAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Saut\u00e9, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1 to 2 more minutes.\n\n4 Simmer the brisket and roast it: Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.\nMove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop.Cover the pot, then place in the 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C) oven. Cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.\n\n5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\n\n6 Remove brisket: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.\n7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.\nTo make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into a blender, and pur\u00e9e until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.\n8 Slice and serve: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the \"grain\" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices.

Set the temperature to 158\u00b0F and let the water come up to temperature.\n2 Prep the chicken: Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, and place them in gallon-sized zip-top freezer bag with the lemon arranged over top.\nMake sure the chicken is in a single layer. If you need to use two bags, that\u2019s better than having overlapping chicken pieces.\n\n3 Seal the bag: Seal the bag with as little air as possible by using water-displacement method to press out all the air: Just slowly lower the bag with the chicken into the water, letting the pressure of the water press the air out of the bag. Once the top of the bag reaches the water line and all the air has been pressed out, seal the bag. (Read more here.)\nYou can do this in the pot of water as it heats. (Just be careful if the water is already steaming!)\nSet the chicken aside on a kitchen towel until the water has finished heating.

How long to cook? Depends on how hot your fire is. At least 3 hours. Maybe as many as 5 hours. You really, really want to slow-cook these ribs because they are pretty fatty. The slower you cook them, the more fat renders out and the smoother your ribs will be.

Return the dish to the oven and cook for an additional five minutes, until the cheese has melted.\n\n10 Cool and serve: Remove the pastel\u00f3n from the oven. Allow it to cool for at least fifteen minutes before slicing and serving, which helps it maintain its shape when sliced.\nLeftovers can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to three days.

Keep it in its plastic wrapping until you are ready to cook it. While in the refrigerator, and or while you are bringing it to room temp, have the bird resting in a pan, so that if the plastic covering leaks for any reason, you are confining the juices to the pan. If you get a frozen goose, which is most likely the case, you will need to defrost it in the refrigerator for two days first.\nWhile I have never found any instances of food poisoning from raw duck or goose, it\u2019s best to handle the goose with common sense. Use a separate cutting board and utensils to avoid contaminating other foods. Wash your hands with soap frequently \u2013 if for no other reason than because geese are fatty and you don\u2019t want to be walking around with greasy hands. Use paper towels to clean up.\n\nRemove the neck, giblets, wing tips\nRemove the neck and giblets (heart, gizzard, liver). Use them for making the gravy. You want to remove the last two joints of the wings, too, and use them for the gravy as well.\n\nTo do this, use a thin sharp knife \u2013 a boning knife is ideal, or you could use a paring knife or fillet knife \u2013 and cut across the side of the joint, severing the tendons. Bend the joint the opposite way it is supposed to go to break it. Cut the remaining skin and tendons. You should not need to cut bone at all.\nSlice off the neck skin about a half inch in front of the body.\n\n\nRemove the excess fat\nYou also need to remove excess fat from the goose. You will want to save it \u2013 goose fat is among the most delicious of all cooking fats, and it is far healthier than butter or lard.\nFirst grab the fat inside the body cavity and put it in a bowl.\n\nNow slice off the wide belly flaps covering the body cavity; if you plan on stuffing the goose you\u2019d need these, but we\u2019re not, so out they go. You also want to remove the Pope\u2019s nose, which is the goose\u2019s tail. All of this should go into a pot with a little water (about \u00bd cup) and put over low heat to render out.\n\n\nPrick the goose's skin all over with a needle\nYou still need to give all that fat underneath the goose\u2019s skin somewhere to go\u2014if you don\u2019t, the skin will never fully crisp up. I\u2019ve found the best way to do this is to prick it with a clean needle. The technique is to stick the skin from an angle so you are not piercing the meat of the goose, just the skin. Do this all over the goose.\nSeason the goose and place in the oven\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F.\nRub the goose all over with the cut half of a lemon. Use both sides to get it good and coated. Put the halves inside the goose.\n\nSprinkle salt liberally all over the goose. Use more salt than you think you need; it helps crisp the skin and adds a lot to the flavor.\nSlice off the top of a head of garlic and place it inside the goose.\nPlace the goose breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan and into the oven.\n\n\nStart the gravy\nMeanwhile, start the gravy. Chop and brown all the giblets, wings and neck in some goose fat in a large pan. Sprinkle salt over them.\n\nAdd the chopped onion and stir to combine. When the onion gets a little browned, sprinkle the flour in the pot and stir to combine. Cook this over medium heat, stirring often, until it smells nutty\u2014about 5-10 minutes. Turn the heat up to high and add the Madeira.\n\nLet this boil furiously for a minute or two, then add the chicken stock and stir to combine. Add the dried thyme. Turn the gravy down to a bare simmer.\n\nAdd root vegetables to the roasting pan\nAfter the goose has cooked for 20 minutes, add any chunks of root veggies you might feel like using. I like a mix of potatoes, turnips, carrots and parsnips. Here\u2019s a tip: Toss them in some rendered goose fat and salt them before placing in the bottom of the roasting pan.\nYou can also use this time as an opportunity to spoon out some of the goose fat that may be collecting in the bottom of the roasting pan. Put it in the pot with the rendering goose fat.\nWhen you\u2019re done, put the goose back into the oven for another 20 minutes.\n\nCarve out the breasts\nWhen a total of 40 minutes of cooking time has elapsed, test the temperature of the breast. You should have something between 130 and 140 degrees. If you\u2019re there, remove the goose but keep the oven on.\n\nNow you need to carve off the whole breasts. Using a thin knife\u2014again, a boning knife is ideal\u2014make a slice where the breast meets the leg and another slice where the breast meets the wing.\n\nThen slice along the keel bone, which separates the two halves of the breast. Go straight down and tap the point of the blade against the breastbone as you move the knife up toward the wishbone, then back toward the open body cavity.\n\nKnow that a goose has a deep keel and that the breastbone comes out wide at almost a right angle from it, so work your knife in short, gentle strokes out to free the whole side of the breast. Once you get near the wishbone, find it with the tip of your knife and carefully slice around it. Repeat on the other side.\n\nRemove the breasts and tent with foil.\n\nFinish cooking the rest of the goose\nPut the goose (minus the breasts) back into the oven. Let this cook for another 30 to 40 minutes.\nWatch the goose gravy. If it gets too thick, add a little water.\nAfter 30 minutes, probe the thickest part of the goose\u2019s thigh with a thermometer. Remove the goose when the temperature is between 165-170\u00b0F. Check the root veggies, and if they are done, great. If not, keep them in the oven for the moment.\nRemove the garlic from the goose.

Wrap again with another plastic bag to ensure that the marinating lamb doesn't leak.\nMarinate for several hours, or overnight, in the refrigerator.\nRemove the lamb, still in its marinade bag, from the refrigerator at least an hour (preferably two hours) before putting in the oven to help bring the lamb closer to room temperature before roasting.\n\n2 Preheat oven and arrange racks: Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Arrange two racks in the oven - a middle rack to hold the lamb, and a lower rack to hold a roasting pan with which to catch the drippings.\nNote that this arrangement of racks and pans, with the roast sitting directly on the oven rack, will create a natural convection of heat in the oven, causing the roast to cook more quickly than if cooked the traditional method in a rack in a roasting pan.\n3 Season lamb and place in oven: Remove the lamb roast from its marinade bag (you may want to temporarily place lamb in another roasting pan, just to make it less messy to work with.) Pat dry the marinade off the lamb with paper towels.\nGenerously salt and pepper all sides of the roast. Arrange the roast fattiest side up, so while the lamb is cooking the fat will melt into the meat.\nPlace the roast directly on middle rack of the oven, with a roasting pan on a separate rack a rung lower, to catch the drippings. You may also want to put some water in the bottom roasting pan, so that the drippings fall into the water instead of burning in the hot pan and smoking up your kitchen.\n\n4 Roast: Roast at 425\u00b0F for 20 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 300\u00b0F and roast an additional 40 minutes (for a 6 pound boneless roast) to an hour (for a 6 pound bone-in roast). If you are cooking a roast bone-in, the bone will act as an insulator and will require a longer cooking time than a boneless roast.\nIn general estimate 10-13 minutes per pound for total cooking time (for rare), including that first 20 minutes at high heat. (Assuming you let the roast sit out for an hour or two before putting it in the oven. If it's right out of the fridge, it will take longer to cook.)\nNote that the method of cooking directly on the oven rack will mimic a convection oven and the cooking time/oven temp needed will be less than you would need if you cooked the roast on a rack in a roasting pan. If you are cooking the roast directly in a roasting pan, rack or not, start the roast at 450\u00b0F and after 20 minutes reduce the heat to 325\u00b0F.\nAlso, the shape of the roast will have an impact on the cooking time. Our roast was rather long and thin, so it cooked up fairly quickly. A thicker roast may take longer than expected.\nSo, use a meat thermometer!\nAbout 20 minutes before you expect the roast to be done, start checking the meat thermometer. Note that every time you open the oven door, you'll need 10 minutes or so to bring the oven back up to temperature, thus slowing down the cooking process. So, don't check too often, or use a remote meat thermometer. Remove the roast from the oven anywhere from 125\u00b0F to 135\u00b0F for medium rare. Lamb should never be cooked until well done or it will be too dry.\n5 Let rest: Let stand for 25-30 minutes before carving (so the juices don't all run out when you cut into it).

Knead in a couple tablespoons of olive oil.\n\nSee the instructions in this red chili sauce recipe for preparing the chili sauce with the ancho chilies. Before you start to handle chilies, either wear protective gloves or rub a little olive oil over your hands. Once you are finished handling chiles, wash your hands well with warm soapy water. Be careful not to touch your eyes if you've been handling chiles!\n1 Open the chiles, remove seeds and stems: Use a sharp knife and make a cut down the side of each chile. Pry open the chiles and remove the seed pods and stems. Pull off any visible veins that run down the insides of the chiles. Reserve a few of the seeds if you need to add them later for more heat.\n2 Soften the chiles by heating them: Heat a large skillet on medium heat. Flatten out the chiles and place them open-side down on the skillet. Press down on them with a metal spatula. After a few seconds turn the chiles over and cook them a few more seconds. Heat them only enough to soften them and to release their flavor, do not heat them to the extent that they would brown or toast.\n3 Soak chiles in hot water: Place the chiles in a small saucepan and cover them with water. Bring the water to a boil and remove the pot from the heat. Let the chiles rest in the hot water for 10 minutes until they have softened. Alternatively, place the chiles in a bowl and pour boiling water over them, let them sit for 15 minutes, until softened.\n4 Blend with garlic, spices: Place the chiles and 1 1/2 cups of the chile soaking water into a blender. Add the garlic, salt, pepper, and ground cloves. Pur\u00e9e until completely smooth, a couple of minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Add more salt and/or chili seeds if needed.\n5 Strain into a skillet, then simmer: Place a sieve over a skillet and pour the sauce into the sieve, pressing it through to the skillet. Heat the skillet and bring the sauce to a simmer. Add a tablespoon of olive oil. Simmer for 10 minutes, skimming off any foam. Remove from heat.\nIf you are using frozen banana leaves (available at many Asian and Mexican markets), rinse them under warm water to defrost. Cut away the thick edges of the leaves.\n\nIf you are using fresh banana leaves, also cut away the thick edges (and central stem if you are using freshly cut leaves). Note that you can cut off sinewy strips from the stem edge of the banana leaves to use as ties for the tamales. Rinse the leaves.\nBanana leaves may be brittle and tear when you try to fold them. One way I've heard of to soften them is to soak them in warm, salted water for about an hour. Another way to soften them which I have found effective, is to hold them over heat, either over a gas burner or a hot pan for a few seconds. Heat them only enough so that they turn color (brighter green) and soften. If you heat them too long, they will toast and become brittle again.\n\nCut the banana leaves into rectangles about 8\"x10\". Dry off with a towel.\n1 Saut\u00e9 the vegetables: Coat the bottom of a very large saut\u00e9 pan with 1-2 Tbsp olive oil. Heat to high heat. Add the onions, garlic, and carrots. Saut\u00e9 for a couple of minutes, stirring constantly.\nThen add the tomatoes and squash. Saut\u00e9 for a couple more minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt.\nAdd the spinach and cook, stirring, until just wilted. Remove from heat.\n\n2 Add chile sauce: Stir in 1/2 cup of chile sauce to the vegetables. Taste. Add more salt if needed.\nBanana leaves have two sides. One side, the top of the leaf, is deep green and has somewhat thick ridges. The other side, the bottom of the leaf, is lighter green and is smoother. According to Diana Kennedy (and they guy I talked to at the local Mexican market) you will want to place the masa on the lighter green, smoother side of the leaf. (I've done it both ways and haven't found it making that big of a difference to the taste.)\n1 Press some masa into center of banana leaf rectangle: Lay out the rectangle piece of banana leaf, light side up. Place a 1/4 to a 1/3 of a cup of masa on the center of the banana leaf. Press down on it with the palm of your hand to spread it out a bit.\n2 Add chili sauce, cheese, vegetable filling: Place a small bit (about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon) of the red chili sauce on the masa. Place a strip of Monterey Jack cheese on top. Scoop some of the vegetable mixture (1/4 to 1/3 cup) on top of the cheese and masa.\n\n3 Fold banana leaf to form tamale: Bring together the two long sides of the banana leaf and fold over, tucking one edge over the other if you can (if not, don't sweat it). Fold the two remaining sides under the tamale.\n\n4 Secure: Secure with a piece of kitchen string, or with some of the long stringy pieces that you can cut from the stem edge of the banana leaves.\nYou can also make ties by pulling off some long thin strips from the larger part of the banana leaf and tying them together to form a long enough strip with which to tie up a tamale. Or, you can skip the tying step all together and just fold them well.\n\nIf upon your first attempt to wrap a tamale the banana leaf is too brittle and tears, you may need to soften the banana leaves by heating them first as mentioned earlier.\n1 Assemble steamer in pot with water, line with banana leaves: Place a steamer rack in the bottom of a very large stockpot. Add enough water to almost come up to the level of the steam rack, about 3/4 or 1 inch. Line the top of the steam rack with banana leaves.\n\n2 Layer with tamales and banana leaves: Carefully place the tamales in layers on the bottom of the pan.

The interior marbling will flavor the meat, whereas the outer fat layer will produce flare ups on the grill, which can add a burnt (not charred) flavor to the steak.\n\n2 Season the steak and refrigerate: Pat the steak dry with a paper towel. This removes surface moisture and will help you achieve a good sear.\nSeason each side with salt and pepper and rub them in a bit. Put the steak in the fridge, uncovered, for at least an hour and up to 48 hours.\n3 Make the herbed butter: In a small saucepan, add butter, herbs, garlic, and shallots. Melt over low heat. Do this at least 10 minutes before you are ready to put the steak on the grill. The longer the herbs sit in the butter, the longer the flavors will infuse.\nYou can also make this butter up to 2 hours beforehand; if so, cover and refrigerate. Gently reheat the butter to melt it again before you put the steaks on the grill.\n\n4 Preheat the grill: Prepare a charcoal grill for two-zone grilling, so half is hot and one half is warm. The grill is hot when you can only hold your hand over the hot zone for a second or two.\nOn a gas grill, heat the grill to 450\u00b0F with two burners going, which should only take about 10 minutes, then turn one of the burners down to medium to create two cooking zones.\n\n5 Cook and baste the steak: Add the steak to the hottest side of the grill. Close the lid and sear for 2 minutes. Open the lid, flip the steak, and baste it with the melted herb butter and herbs. Close the lid. Cook for 2 additional minutes.\nFlip the steak again and move it to a lower heat side. Baste it again with butter. Continue flipping and basting every two minutes for the next 6 minutes, closing the lid between each flip.\nAfter the steak has been on the grill for a total of 10 minutes (for medium-rare steak), transfer it to a clean platter; it should read 137\u00b0F to 140\u00b0F internally. Baste it again with butter.

Add the pork chops and cook until brown, about 4 minutes per side. If your pork chops are thin cuts, this may be all the cooking they need. If thicker, lower the heat to low and cover the pot. Cook for a few minutes more until the chops are just cooked through, about 145\u00b0F.\n4 Finish the sauce: When about to serve the pork, bring the sauce to a simmer and add the chopped basil to it.

Chicken pieces should be covered with the buttermilk. Let it sit for at least an hour or up to overnight.\n2 Bread the chicken: To prepare the breading mixture, stir together flour, seasoned salt, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika.\nRemove chicken pieces from buttermilk and shake off any excess; then dip in the flour mix and coat well. Transfer breaded chicken pieces to a clean plate or wire rack to rest.\n\n3 Air-fry the chicken: You will need to work in two batches if you are doing a full chicken. Spray the basket of your air fryer with nonstick spray. Place half of the pieces in the basket of your air fryer. Try to ensure the pieces don\u2019t touch. Air needs to circulate around them.\nSpray the chicken pieces lightly with spray oil. Place the basket in the air fryer and turn the air fryer to 350\u00b0F. Cook for 14 minutes, then flip the fried chicken with tongs, spray lightly with oil a second time on the bottom side of the chicken, and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes.\nThe half-breast pieces and the wings will be done on the low end of that time range, and the dark meat pieces will need a full 24 to 26 minutes of time to be cooked through. The dark meat pieces should reach 175\u02daF.\n(NOTE: My method photo here only shows the temp at 148\u02daF to illustrate that the chicken can LOOK cooked but is actually not cooked through. A meat thermometer is vital.)\nDuring the air frying process, if you pull out the chicken and notice any dry flour spots on the chicken, spray those spots lightly with oil. The breading will never crisp up if it doesn\u2019t have a tiny bit of oil to hydrate it. It will just burn.\n\n4 Serve: When the fried chicken is ready, let it rest on a plate for a few minutes before serving.

Create a large well or crater in the center, big enough to hold the eggs and olive oil like bowl. Place the eggs, yolk, olive oil and salt into the well. Use a fork to whisk together the eggs and oil.\nContinue whisking the eggs, but begin pulling in bits of flour from inside the well. Use a stirring motion and go slowly to avoid any eggs breaking through the bowl of flour. (If the eggs break through your flour while mixing, don\u2019t panic. Simply push some additional flour up against the break-through with your hand or with a bench scraper, and continue mixing).\nContinue like this until the dough starts to come together and the eggs have been incorporated. The dough will be damp in and chunky in some parts and loose in others, and the mixture will still be quite floury. That\u2019s ok. Use your hands or a bench scraper to continue bringing the dough together. I scoop the damp and crumbled dough up with my bench scraper and cut it into the rest of the dough.\n\n2 Knead the dough: When the dough looks relatively cohesive, but still a bit scraggly, form it into a ball, and knead for 10 minutes against the counter. The dough will be rough at first, but it should begin to tighten up and smooth out as you continue kneading.\nIf the dough sticks to your hands, dust the countertop with a little more flour. In the end you should have a soft, elastic dough that feels smooth like a baby\u2019s bottom, and isn\u2019t sticky.\n\n3 Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest on your counter to rest for an hour. After an hour, continue to the next step, refrigerate the dough for tomorrow (no more than 24 hours), or freeze the dough.\n(To freeze a ball of pasta dough, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap then set it inside a zip-top bag with the air squeezed out of it. No need for oil.)\n\n4 Roll out the pasta: When the dough has finished resting, shape it into a fat log and cut it into 5 or 6 equal sections. Leave one section out and rewrap the others. (If you are working on a small counter, you can cut each piece in half again so you are working with less dough.)\nFlour your counter well, and use your rolling pin to roll out the dough into a long strip. With each pass as you roll, lift the dough up, re-dust the counter beneath, and flip it over. When you\u2019re finished, you should have a long, thin piece of dough It should be just about paper thin, but strong enough to be lifted off of the countertop.\n\n5 Loosely fold the pasta strip like an accordion: Dust the strip of dough with more flour. Starting with the short end, loosely fold like an accordion. (An accordion fold like the one pictured here helps prevent the dough from sticking to itself better than rolling it up like a cigar.)\n\n6 Cut the stack into strips: Use a very sharp knife to cut the stack across the folds into thin strips. You can cut the strips as thin or as a thick as you prefer (like thin linguini or like wide fettuccine), but try to stay consistent otherwise the noodles will cook at different rates.\n\n7 Dry the noodles: Unroll the bundle of noodles and lay them across your dining room table, kitchen island or the back of a chair. Let them dry for about 15 minutes.\n\n8 Continue rolling out and cutting the rest of the pasta.\n9 Use or freeze the noodles: At this point, the noodles will still be pliable, but dry. They can be used immediately or frozen for later.\nIf freezing, gather the noodles into several small, loose bundles. Be careful of compressing the noodles too much; it\u2019s fine to just gather them together. Place the noodle nests on a well-floured baking sheet, then freeze. Once frozen, transfer the nests to a large Ziploc bag, and use as needed. Frozen noodles will keep for 9 months.\n\n10 Cook the noodles: Bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add the fresh or frozen pasta and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until chewy and al dente (taste one of the noodles to check).

You can opt to keep the crab meat in the body segments and serve it that way (more work for the eater) or you can pick out the crab meat from the body segments.\nIf you pick out the crab meat, try to keep it in big chunks. Keep the top shell of the crab for making stock.\nNote you can use prepared fish or shellfish stock, or you can make your own. If you are not making your own stock, you can discard the crab top shell body. If prepared shellfish stock is not available, I would combine some prepared fish stock (available at many markets, including Trader Joe's) with clam juice.\n3 Prepare the shrimp: Split the shrimp shells down the back and remove the black vein. (See how to peel and devein shrimp.) I found the easiest way to do this, without removing the shell, is to lay the shrimp on its side and insert a small knife into the large end of the shrimp, with the blade pointing outward from the back (away from the shrimp and your hands).\nOnce you have split the shrimp shells, you can turn the knife toward the shrimp, and cut in a little to find the black vein. Pull out the vein as much as you can. You can probably also use a pair of kitchen scissors to cut the backs of the shrimp.\nAlternatively, you can shell the shrimps and devein them. Shell-on imparts more flavor; shell-off is easier to eat.\n4 Make the soup base: In a deep 8-quart covered pot, saut\u00e9 onions and bell pepper on medium heat in olive oil until soft.

Grip the loosened membrane and pull away to remove.\n\nCut the racks in half. Put in a plastic ziplock freezer bag. Add the brine to the bag. Squeeze the excess air out of the bag and seal the bag. Massage the brine into the ribs. Place the bag of brine and ribs into a bowl (in case there is leakage) and place into the refrigerator.\nRefrigerate in the brine for 3-6 hours. Note that brining too long can over-saturate the meat with the brine. So stick within the 3-6 hour time frame.\n3 Prepare bourbon glaze: Heat bourbon with sugar, peppers, and salt. Whisk in butter until melted. Set aside or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. Warm before using.

Pat dry the ribs with paper towels. Brush grill grates with olive oil or canola oil. Place the ribs on the side of the grill away from the source of heat, either gas or briquets. Cover the grill.\n\nIf you are using a gas grill, lower the burners so that you are maintaining a temperature of about 300\u00b0F-325\u00b0F in the grill.\nIf you are charcoal grilling, cover the grill so that the air vent on the kettle top is directly over the ribs. This way smoke from the charcoal will waft its way over the ribs on the way out of the grill.\nAdjust the vents so that the air flow is much reduced. Reducing the size of the air vents is a way to help control the temperature in the grill and keep it low. Fire lives off of oxygen, so if you reduce the oxygen, you reduce the amount of burning and heat. If you close the vents too much, the charcoals will put out too little heat, so the trick is to maintain a balance - enough air flow to keep the coals alive, but not too much or the grill will run too hot and your ribs will overcook.\n\nTry to maintain a temperature of about 300\u00b0F-325\u00b0F in the grill. If you are using a charcoal grill that doesn't have a built-in thermometer, you can put a meat thermometer through the grill air vent to take a reading of the temp.\n6 Flip ribs over, check for doneness: After 20-25 minutes of cooking, use tongs to flip the rib racks over. If you are charcoal grilling, shift the ends of the ribs as well so that the end that was facing the coals now faces the edge of the grill.\n\nCheck for doneness using a meat thermometer after 15-20 more minutes. They are done and ready to pull off at 155\u00b0F, but you want to get to them 10 minutes or so before they are done to apply the glaze.\n7 Apply bourbon glaze: At about 145\u00b0F start applying the spicy bourbon glaze. Brush the ribs with the glaze syrup, turning and basting the ribs until the syrup has been used up. When an instant read thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of the ribs reads 155\u00b0F, the ribs are ready to take off the grill.\nNote that depending on the amount of heat in the grill and the size of your ribs, the ribs could be done in as little as 45 minutes or as long as 1 1/2 hours. If the grill temperature stays more at about 350\u00b0F, then the ribs will be done faster. It's hard to maintain a charcoal grill lower than 350\u00b0F, though ideally for these ribs you do want the temp lower, closer to 300\u00b0F. Also note again that baby backs are smaller than St. Louis style and will cook faster.\n\n8 Remove the ribs to a large serving platter and cut into 1 or 2-rib sections."}, {"title": "Pasta with Spinach, Mushrooms, and Brown Butter", "total_time": 20, "ingredients": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds mushrooms, sliced (See Recipe Note)", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/8 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 pound small shaped pasta, such as orecchiette, bowties, campanelle, or shells", "5 ounces (4 to 5 large handfuls) baby spinach leaves", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan (for garnish)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (for garnish)"], "instructions": "1 Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

(See the touch test.) If you wait until you see juice oozing out of the top of a chop, it is definitely done. You can also check the internal temperature of the pork with a digital thermometer; when the pork registers 145\u00b0F in the middle, it\u2019s done."}, {"title": "Grilled Pork Tenderloin and Peaches", "total_time": 45, "ingredients": ["1 pork tenderloin", "Extra virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon herbes de Provence", "1-2 yellow peaches or nectarines, quartered or cut into thick slices"], "instructions": "1 Prep the tenderloin: Coat the tenderloin with olive oil, then sprinkle with salt.

Sprinkle with cider vinegar (about a Tbsp) and salt (about a tsp). Mix in the vinegar and salt. Peel avocado and remove seed. Chop and reserve for later.\n3 Heat the tortillas: Unless you have made fresh tortillas from scratch, you will need to soften them somehow. One way to easily soften and heat a tortilla to simply heat it in the microwave for 20-25 seconds on high heat, on top of a napkin or paper towel to absorb the moisture that is released. We often will heat two tortillas at once in the microwave, heating them for a total of 40 seconds.\nAnother way is to heat a well seasoned (black) large cast iron skillet to medium heat. Add a teaspoon of oil to the pan or spread a half a teaspoon of butter on one side of one tortilla. Place tortilla in the pan (butter side down if you are using butter).\nAs the tortilla sizzles, flip the tortilla with a spatula so that the other side gets some of the oil or butter from the pan. Continue to flip every 10-30 seconds until the tortillas begins to develop air pockets, about a minute. If the pan begins to smoke, lower the temperature.\nYou can skip the butter or oil if you wish and just heat the tortillas up on the skillet without them. We have found that the flavor of packaged tortillas benefits from heating them with a bit of oil.\nRemove the tortilla from the pan and place it folded on a plate. If the pan is large enough you can prepare two or more tortillas at once. Continue until all the tortillas (estimate 3 per person) are cooked. Set aside.\n4 Cook the fish: Rinse the fish fillets in cold water. Pat dry with a paper towel. Heat a large stick-free skillet to medium high heat. Add a couple of teaspoons of olive oil to the skillet. Place fish on skillet.\nCooking time depends on the thickness of the fillets. A thin fillet may take only one minute on each side to cook. A thicker fillet may take a couple of minutes. Fish should be still barely translucent when cooked.\nBreak off a piece and test if you are not sure. Do not overcook the fish. Remove from pan when done to a separate plate. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n5 Assemble the fish tacos: I think tacos are best when you assemble them yourself.

It can be refrigerated, or not\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n2 Make the sauce: In a shallow bowl, whisk together the fish sauce, vinegar, tamarind concentrate, and sugar until smooth. Taste. Adjust the sauce as needed. Add a pinch of paprika or cayenne powder for color.\n\n3 Bring a large pot of water to boil.\n4 Divide all of your ingredients into two batches. Arrange them near your stove.

Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil. When the oil starts to shimmer a bit, it\u2019s ready.\nCrack the eggs for this batch into the pan and, using the tip of a wooden spoon, gently loosen and break the yolk. You want to have enough oil in the pan so it looks as though the egg is floating, or suspended, in the oil. This gives you more surface area to cook the egg without it burning or turning it into scrambled eggs.\nGently shake and flip the egg around in the pan. Break it up a bit with the spoon, but don\u2019t scramble it by any means. This should take about a minute.\n\n6 Cook the shrimp: Add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of oil to the pan if the pan seems too dry, and add the shrimp for this batch. Toss them gently in the pan and move them around with the wooden spoon to get some color on them, about a minute.\n\n7 Soften the noodles: Take several handfuls of your noodles (about half the total amount) out of the water they\u2019re soaking in, and transfer to a fine mesh sieve. Hold the sieve over the pot of hot water and gently dip the noodles up and down, in and out of the water, to soften them but not cook per se. (Using the sieve saves you from having to cook it and then strain it, enables you to use the pot of water more than once, and it makes the whole process move more quickly.)\nShake out the excess hot water and taste to make sure the noodles have softened but still have a little give to them.\n\n8 Add the noodles to the pan: Transfer the noodles to the hot pan with the shrimp. Keep the noodles long; don\u2019t chop them up in the pan (long noodles mean long life, Chef Peter says). Taste to make sure they have softened; the noodles don\u2019t need to be completely cooked at this point because they will continue to cook in the wok.\nToss them gently in the pan and stir them briefly to keep them from sticking together. When the noodles look shiny, it\u2019s time for the sauce.\n\n9 Add the sauce: Quickly whisk the sauce if the sugar seems to have settled, and add about 1/4 cup to the pan. Gently toss and flip the noodles in the pan.\nAgain, stir them quickly to integrate the sauce; when you can\u2019t see any more sauce in the pan, you'll know it's ready and that the noodles have absorbed the sauce.\n10 Add the peanuts and bean sprouts: Add the peanuts and the sprouts, and toss all ingredients together quickly. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until everything is heated through. The noodles will soften and look more translucent.\n\n11 Taste and serve: Turn the heat off the pan and taste to make sure there is enough sauce to flavor the dish.

(This also helps prevent the dish from burning on the bottom during cooking!)\n4 Add the remaining ingredients and the broth: Stir in the rice, then pour in the rest of the hot broth with the peas and saffron. Push down any grains of rice from the sides of the pot, making sure that everything is submerged in the cooking liquid.\n\n5 Pressure cook the paella: Secure the lid on the pressure cooker, and make sure the pressure regulator is in its \u201cSealing\u201d position. Cancel the \u201cSaut\u00e9\u201d cooking program, then select the \u201cManual\u201d or \u201cPressure Cook\u201d program and set the cooking time to 5 minutes at high pressure.\nThe pot will take 5 to 10 minutes to come up to pressure, and then the cooking program will begin counting down.\n\n6 Release the pressure: When the cooking program ends, let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then release the remaining pressure by moving the pressure regulator to its \u201cVenting\u201d position.\n\n7 Serve: When the pressure has fully released, open the pot. Scoop onto plates, garnish with chopped parsley, and serve it piping hot. Leftovers will keep for about a week.\nYou may get a crust of dark caramelization and crunchy rice at the bottom of the pan -- this is ok! This is called \"socarrat\" and is traditional for paella. Just mix it in and enjoy!\n"}, {"title": "Chicken and Avocado Salad with Buttermilk Dressing", "total_time": 30, "ingredients": ["1 tablespoon finely chopped shallots", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "1/2 cup buttermilk", "2 tablespoons chopped chives", "4 slices of crusty artisan-style bread", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 clove garlic, peeled", "2 hearts of romaine, leaves torn in half, or any other crunchy leafy salad green", "2 cups shredded or sliced leftover chicken", "2 medium ripe avocadoes, sliced", "A small piece of Parmesan (about 1 ounce), shaved with a vegetable peeler"], "instructions": "1 Make the dressing: In a small mixing bowl or a jam jar, combine the shallots, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Stir them with a wooden spoon or shake the pan from time to time. You may hear them squeak.\nSprinkle salt over the mushrooms. The mushrooms will sizzle and then start to release water. (Note that you are not adding fat at this point to the pan; this method of cooking mushrooms in their own moisture is called \"dry saut\u00e9ing.)\nOnce the mushrooms start to release water into the pan, stir in the chopped onions. Cook until the mushrooms are no longer releasing moisture and the mushroom water has boiled away, about 5 minutes more.\n\n2 Make the sauce: Add the olive oil to the mushrooms and stir to coat. Saut\u00e9 the mushrooms and onions for about a minute. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.\nStir in the tomato paste, cook for a minute longer. Reserve 1 cup of the tomato sauce (it will go in the bottom of the casserole dish), and put the remaining cup of tomato sauce into the pot with the mushrooms. Add the large can of crushed tomatoes and one cup of water.\nStir in the thyme, sugar, and red pepper flakes. (If you are using dried basil instead of fresh, add it now.) Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer on a low simmer, for 20 minutes.\n\n3 Boil and drain the lasagna noodles: Once the sauce is simmering, salt the boiling pasta water, and add the dry lasagna noodles to the boiling water. (The water should be at a vigorous, rolling boil.) Stir gently, making sure that the noodles are not sticking to each other. Set the timer for 8 minutes, or however long is indicated on the package of the noodles. Cook uncovered on a high boil.\nWhen the noodles are ready (al dente, cooked through but still firm to the bite), drain the noodles in a colander, and rinse them to cool them with cold water. As you rinse them, gently separate them with your fingers so they don't stick to each other.\n\nPrepare a couple large cookie sheets or baking sheets by spreading a tablespoon of olive oil over the baking sheets.\nPlace the lasagna noodles on the sheets, gently coating them with a bit of that olive oil, and spreading them out. This will help keep them from sticking to each other while you finish the sauce and prepare the layered casserole.\n\n4 Assemble the lasagna: Turn off the heat on the stovetop for the sauce. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.\nSpread the one cup of reserved tomato sauce over the bottom of a large (preferably 10x15-inch) casserole dish.

Sprinkle half of the fresh basil over the sauce.\n\n\n5 Repeat layers: Repeat the layering process. Place a second layer of noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining ricotta, spinach, and mozzarella over the noodles. Sprinkle another quarter of the pecorino along with the mozzarella. Top with another third of the mushroom sauce and the remaining fresh basil.\nLayer your final layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining sauce over the lasagna noodles, and sprinkle with the remaining pecorino or parmesan cheese.\n\n6 Cover with foil and bake: Pull out a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to cover the casserole dish. Spread a little olive oil over the inside of the piece of foil (the side that will have contact with the lasagna). Place the foil over the casserole dish and crimp the edges.\nBake at 350\u00b0F for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake uncovered for an additional 25 minutes.\nTake the lasagna out of the oven when done and let it rest 10 minutes before cutting to serve.
